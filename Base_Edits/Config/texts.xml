This is a unique opportunity for your company! There is virtually no transport infrastructure here. You should take advantage of this.

The recently discovered deposits of iron ore are very exciting. Foundries have government support to process more iron ore, but it can't transport itself.

This is the perfect moment for our company to enter this market. I've successfully negotiated financial support from the local authorities, but as a part of the contract, they want us to transport coal too.

Hello,

We would like to agree a deal with you to build a railway to our city. We've negotiated financial support from the cities around us, but you should start with something more politically important. That's us.

The contract would include the construction of platforms, tracks and, afterwards, running services. We want to give people transport for work and for culture. Make sure your trains show that the government cares about them!

Greetings my child,

Our modest parish lacks a place to pray and shelter. From the community, we acquired a very old derelict church which we would like to repair. Our followers will help us, but we need building materials. That's why I'd like to ask you for help. We took a collection from our congregation. It's not much, but maybe it will be enough.

Despite the initial mistrust of the local foundry owner, we negotiated an important contract with him. The transport of iron ingots from his foundries is still our biggest project. Maybe we'll need some additional trains or extensions for our stations, but the initial investment will be worth it.

My friend, I have a strong feeling that you've spent the last few months working too hard and you need to take a break.

Your railway empire is doing great, you know, but you should take a well deserved break from time to time.

Jump into one of your modern trains, enjoy a sandwich in one of your dining cars, or ride on the engine with one of your skilled drivers. Take a break and enjoy the beautiful countryside from your train.

Good day,

As you probably know, earlier this decade we introduced a state-of-the-art diesel locomotive - the Bdz 52. We are currently finishing our latest upgraded version of the 52, which we are starting to test in operation. Whilst maintaining the same operating costs, we've managed to achieve better speed and performance. This makes it ideal for carrying passengers on longer routes.

As you already use some 52s, we want to offer our prototype 52+ for testing. As I said, it's best used on passenger trains. If everything succeeds, we'll give you that locomotive and another 52+ for free.

So are you in?

Wow, this time I have really amazing news. Sources at the Ministry of Industry suggest that recently in this region prospectors found small deposits of Black Gold - OIL!

The government naturally saw the potential of this and the ministry is already using subsidies to attract investors to drill. There is almost certainly more oil out there and if we act quickly, we could make a solid profit from this.

From this oil discovery will come industries for fuel and chemicals, so we have a great opportunity to improve our locomotive fleet with diesel powered engines. It'll need us to invest, but the rewards will be great!

Greetings,

Some time ago, we were dealing with the oil import contract and I would like to follow up on it. We need to find a solution for the transportation of petroleum products and chemicals from our refineries. Most of the shipping companies around are useless!

Our warehouses are sometimes so full that we have to stop production and it costs us massive amounts of money. I'm not going to pay to run the refinery if it's not producing anything. Maybe I should just shut it down instead...

Anyway, that's where you come in. Deliver these products for me, get my supply chain moving again and save my business!

Sir,

A businessman from Trans and Cargo contacted me with an offer. They have an old steam locomotive for sale. Coincidentally, I know quite a lot about it. The old Porter has been stored in an old depot, since an exhibition many years ago. I don't think they know what to do with it. It's a beautiful old locomotive, but what would we do with that old wreck in our company?

It's a modified 2-6-0, but it doesn't feel like a good investment for us, especially for such a lot of money.

For a long time, we've walked by that locomotive sat behind our upper depot... It's been left to rust for at least a couple of winters. According to our documents it doesn't belong to us, but nobody is claiming her.

It's a shame to leave it like that, isnt it?

Hello,

As the owner of a local steelworks, we've been working with the southwest mine and stocking up the sand carriages for a couple of years. However, our silicon steel process has advanced and we are now able to produce much more steel using less quartz (sand). The demand for our steel grows and we have no way to deliver it to surrounding factories, so I have an offer for you.

I understand you are a capable businessman, just missing some %0. If we make a deal, I'll give you a certain amount of %0 right now, and a couple of surplus sand wagons. Then you'll help me first by supplying the raw material for my steelworks and then by delivering steel to the factories. What do you say?

Good day sir,

It's been a long time since we last worked together to get subsidies from the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Today, I would like to draw your attention to another new opportunity.

More companies and young people are moving to our region. The Ministry has decided to improve service and reliability and build a main line for fast traffic between several key cities. People should be able to easily travel between work and home. You know how young people are demanding comfort and speed nowadays.

The Ministry are hoping for even more dramatic development of our region, and your company will benefit from it too.

Hey dude, how's it goin'?

I've seen the new trains you've bought, and they're a totally different league from the crappy old steam ones. I can remember how you started with the first train, such a poor one, and you were glad you could spare some coins for fuel.

I've read somewhere that these new trains can fly - %1 %2, maybe even more. I asked one engine driver and he said that it could be possible, but it needs a high quality, long straight track. And on your rickety old rails, they can't even try...

Hello friend,

Next year we will hold an exhibition of historic locomotives. Unfortunately, the company that normally lends them to us has unexpectedly declined to do so this year. If we don't get a replacement, there will be nothing in the showcase.

Your company is still running these old locos, right? It would be very helpful if you could provide us with one locomotive of each type for the Exhibition. Of course, we are mostly interested in steam engines. A 2-6-0 Porter was sold in a very rare limited edition called Red Dwarf. Do you know who bought it, by any chance? We would be very interested in this one.

Good morning boss,

A large number of foreign investors have responded to the government's tender for power plant construction. According to a representative of one of the international companies, these projects are the big thing for these companies this year.
 
The plan is to expand the current power plant blocks. Some of the new facilities are already being tested. They're scheduled to start providing electricity to the area this year.

Of course, power plants consume huge amounts of fuel, whether it's coal or oil. We've got many years of experience and a massive railway network... So let's do it!

Good morning Boss,

I don't know if you heard already, but YouWing Oil Co. has filed for bankruptcy.

A meteoric rise and equally hard fall of one of the most influential companies in the country. We all watched in awe at their success, but I don't think anyone expected it would end in tears a few years later.

But... The reason I'm mentioning it is because of the liquidation of the company itself. Their assets are for sale and when I checked the inventory, there are several interesting items for us. For example, item 420A is a train set with 2 locomotives and several oil wagons. And the price is very nice.

We let our people inspect the whole train set and the wagons are in  a very sorry state. They also carry the YouWing Oil logo, which isn't the best look with our clients. It's probably not worth restoring and painting them and it'll be better to sell them on. 

But the locomotives will come in handy.

Hello,

Our engineers are building a new train for the MiningCroft Company. Usually these trains transport coal over long distances, almost unimaginable in our country.

Co-operation with this mining company could provide us with more incentives for transportation in the future, and possibly the opening of new mining sites here in our region.

However, we'll need to test the operation of such a long train before we commit to it.

Be sure to connect enough wagons and ideally a second locomotive for this test, especially if you plan to fully load it. In fact, they regularly use three locomotives to achieve the desired pulling power.

We'll also need to discuss the route with the driver; remember that our stations are not built for trains like this.

I'm starting to think this may not be the best idea after all...

Okay, I'll admit I didn't believe we'd do this after our first conversation. But it was spectacular! Such a long train only appears on our network once in a lifetime. Fortunately, everyone knew what to do. Especially the train driver - he did a great job, you should pay him with gold.

And I have good news. I had a call with the manager from MiningComp South. They're planning to expand their coal mining operation in our region after all!

Good day, Sir,

It's a pleasure to meet you - thanks a lot for your consent to a meeting.

I would like to discuss the possibility of a small investment. We plan to restore an old glassworks and the tradition of glass making in our region. We bought an old glassworks and I also have several capable glass makers with many years of experience - the masters in the business.

Unfortunately we don't have enough money to start production yet. According to our calculations, %0 would be enough for us to repair the glassworks and pay those glass makers for the first few months.

Would you like to help us with this?

Good day, Sir,

Good to see you again. It has been a year - quite a long time, but I have good news. Production has started and we've signed a contract with the first customer - but only a small one. We are still looking for some bigger customers and retail chains.

Unfortunately, the whole project needs a lot of money, more than we expected. I will get straight to the point: could you invest more money in us? I can offer you a bigger share in the company. The initial investment has helped us very well in the beginning, but unfortunately the costs of marketing and finding large orders are significantly bigger.

Great!

With such a big partner onboard, we will surely manage to get more customers and increase production (and in turn the value of your share in the glassworks). For such a company like yours, it is not that much money, but trust me, you have helped a few people to fulfill their dreams. Glassmaking has existed in this region from the beginning of the 14th century, and thanks to you it will be around for a while yet.

Currently we are discussing with one potential customer about custom-made glass for their dining cars. I have to put you in touch with him, he's as enthusiastic about trains as you.

I understand. Even so, we greatly appreciate your first investment. We'll try to get an extra loan. I just have to put on my best sweater and ask several banks.

Of course, our production continues - you don't have to worry about your investment. For now, I arranged orders with a few smaller shops just yesterday, which will save us for at least the next month.

If you want your investment back, we have enough funds to repay it now. Of course, we'd be delighted if you remain with us as a partner. 

We're also interested in your rail services, mainly for the transport of sand to our works and, later, the transport of our products to local shops.

The sand that is mined and quarried in the region is of a high enough quality that we can use it to make glass - that's also the reason why the tradition of glassmaking runs so deep here.

In our glassworks, however, our stock of sand is slowly running out - we can't expand production without reliable supplies. Therefore, I need you to deliver more sand from the surrounding mines. I have already set up the storage space, so we can start immediately. At the same time, you could also help us supply city stores with our products.

Greetings, my friend.

Production of glass is at full speed and we have enough sand for almost a year of operation. It would have been difficult to achieve this without you, so you have our eternal gratitude.

Several companies expressed an interest in buying our glassworks. Our main requirement was that we want to stay independent, even after an acquisition. Only Glossy Glasses gave us such guarantees. They have a serious interest in the glassworks and they are the only ones who have accepted our agreement conditions.

Dobrý den,
mé jméno je Abner Dvakrátkup, konzultant.  

Spatřuji pro Vaši firmu jedinečnou příležitost. Zdejší dopravní infrastruktura v podstatě neexistuje a to je situace, která by se měla využít.

Na začátek by bylo ideální začít s přepravou cestujících. Bude to levný zdroj příjmů a umožní to firmě expandovat.

Jen tak dál. I stát má zájem na rozšiřování infrastruktury, proto jsme dostali přislíbenou menší podporu. Můžeš ji investovat do rozšíření dopravní sítě, nebo se podívat po dalších zdrojích příjmu, jako je třeba dovoz klád a uhlí.

Dovolte mi, abych se představil. Jsem Jack Tamiel, zástupce holdingu LMBR co. Naše společnost má v plánu investovat do rozvoje zdejšího průmyslu. Právě proto se obracím na Vás a vaši společnost.

Pokud máš zájem, mám pro tebe další nabídku. Pily produkují více prken, než naše koňská spřežení zvládnou převézt, a pilám se již zaplňují sklady. Proto potřebujeme spojit pily a nástrojárny železnicí a převoz tím urychlit.

chtěli bychom s vámi uzavřít kontrakt na vybudování železnice z našeho města. Máme přislíbenou finační podporu z okolních měst, ale začít můžete u toho politicky pro nás nejdůležitějšího. 

Kontrakt by zahrnoval vybudování nástupišť, stavbu kolejí a následně i zajištění přepravy pasažérů. Chceme tím lidem nabídnout levnou přepravu za prací a za kulturou. Ať všichni vidí, že se jejich zastupitelé starají.

Zdravím tě synu,

naše skromná farnost postrádá místo k modlení a úkrytu. Od církve jsme získali dlouho zchátralý kostel, který bychom si chtěli opravit. Naši věřící nám s tím pomůžou, ale pořebujume na stavbu materiál. Proto bych tě chtěl požádat o službu. Udělali jsme sbírku, není to mnoho, ale snad to bude stačit.

Přeprava pošty připadla z automobilové dopravy pod kompetenci ministerstva železnic, které se tímto zavázalo dopravovat poštovní zásilky převzatých od poštovní správy. 

Vy máte vybudovanou slušnou železniční infrastrukturu, proto jsme vás pověřili zajištěním přepravy pošty. Berte to jako službu své zemi.

Pověst firmy se roznesla do té míry, že se nám tu hromadí nabídky na služby. Bohužel nemůžeme aktuálně vyhovět úplně všem. Z těch zajímavých jsem vybral dvě, které jsou velice lukrativní. 

Jedná se zakázky na převoz lidí a nebo převoz železa pro nějakého průmyslníka.

máte možnost koupit novou mašinu a vy stále kupujete ty staré křápy. Chtělo by to trochu investovat do nových strojů. Pan Eteborrow by na to určitě dokázal získat nějaký příspěvek, dotaci, nebo něco takového.

- Postavit smyčku tak, aby se vozidlo dopřednou jízdou otočilo, 
- Připojit za konec tratě depo, kam vozidlo vjede a vyjede popředu,

     Prosím mějte na paměti, že se jedná o Alpha verzi hry, která je stále ještě ve vývoji.
     Pracoval jsem na hře více než 7 let a nyní se, spolu s komunitou a talentovanými lidmi
     kolem sebe, snažíme vytvořit nejlepší tycoon, o jakém sníme.
                                                                                                       Jan Zelený

     - Nějaké nedokončené ikonky, popisky, užitečné funkce
     - Občas uvidíte dočasnou grafiku nebo texty.

     \c\c\i8EB66346 \cF0EAC2\bFinální hra bude obsahovat:\b

     - 7 období od doby páry až po moderní železnici
     - 16 různých zboží a 21 průmyslových budov
     - Více než 25 železničních lokomotiv a 40 druhů vagonů 
     - Více příběhů, úkolů a herních událostí
     - Vlaky ovládané hráčem
     - Hra pro až 8 hráčů na jedné mapě
     - Podpora modů skrze Steam Workshop (např. nová vozidla, nové průmyslové budovy, apod.)

Kamaráde, tak mám takový vtíravý pocit, že poslední dobou pro samou práci nemáš čas vydechnout.

Železniční impérium Ti vzkvétá, cožpak o to, ale měl by sis dát občas zasloužený oddech. Projet se třeba jedním z Tvých moderních vlaků, dát si proslulý sendvič v jídelním voze, nebo se svézt spolu s jedním z Tvých oddaných strojvedoucích na jeho stanovišti. Prostě si dát na chvíli pauzu a kochat se krásnou krajinou z uhánějícího vlaku.

Dobrý den,
jak jistě víte, uvedli jsme tuto dekádu na trh nejmodernější naftové lokomotivy. Právě jsme těsně před dokončením vylepšené verze našeho typu 52, který začínáme testovat v provozu. Při zachování stejných provozních nákladů se nám podařilo dosáhnout vyššího výkonu a vyšší maximální rychlosti. S těmito parametry je ideální k přepravě cestujících na delší trasy.

Jelikož již naše lokomotivy používáte, chceme Vám nabídnout k testovacímu provozu náš prototyp 52+. Jak jsem říkal, pro naše účely je ideální ho používat k přepravě cestujících. Pokud se vše zdaří, věnujeme Vám další testovací lokomotivu 52+.

Tak co, půjdete do toho?

Páni, tentokrát mám opravdu úžasné zprávy. Z kruhů blízkých ministru průmyslu jsem se dozvěděl, že se před nějakou dobou v téhle oblasti našlo malé ložisko černého zlata - ropy! 

Nedlouho poté se rozběhla dotační mašinérie a ministerstvo sem už láká investory pro zahájení těžby. Určitě se narazí na více ložisek a když nebudeme stát stranou, mohli bychom na tom solidně profitovat. 

S rozvojem petrochemického průmyslu v našem okolí, jakožto zdroje paliva, bychom měli zase o důvod víc investovat do naftou poháněních motorů pro naše vlaky. Bude to ale chtít počáteční investici a pohnout se z místa, ale určitě se nám to brzo vrátí.

Před nějakou dobou jsme spolu řešili kontrakt na dovoz ropy a já bych na něj chtěl navázat. Potřebujeme vyřešit odvoz ropných produktů/chemikálií z našich rafinerií. Většina přepravních společností tady je naprosto neschopná... Na co je nám nízká cena, když nedodrží závazky?

Naše překladiště jsou někdy tak plná, že musíme zastavit produkci a to stojí peníze, které si ani neumíte představit. Nehodlám platit zbytečné náklady na rafinerie, co stojí a nevyrábí. To je raději nechám zavřít nadobro!

Dobrý den,

Moje ocelárna již pár let spolupracuje s dolem na jihozápadě a dosatečně jsme se předzásobili vagony na písek. Náš proces zušlechťování křemičité oceli ale pokročil a jsme teď schopni vyrobit mnohem více oceli za použití méně křemene (písku). Zájem o naši ocel roste a přestáváme stíhat jeho dodávku do okolních továren, tak bych pro Vás měl nabídku.  

O Vás se proslýchá, že jste schopný obchodník, jen Vám poslední dobou chybí %0. Pokud se domluvíme, dám vám hned teď jistý obnos %0, nebo Vám přenecháme pár nadbytečných vagonů na písek a vy mi pak pomůžete nejprve s dodávkou suroviny pro moji ocelárnu a poté s dodávkou oceli pro místní továrny. Co tomu říkáte?

Dobrá,

Stačí aby je vaši lidé vyzvedli ve vašem depu a můžete je ihned použít.

Dobrý den pane,
již je to nějaká doba od naší poslední spolupráce na získání dotací z ministerstva průmyslu a obchodu. Dnes bych si Vás opět dovolil upozornit na nový program rozvoje. 

Do naše kraje se stěhuje stále více firem a mladých lidí. Ministerstvo se rozhodlo zlepšit obslužnost a vybudovat páteřní linku umožňující rychlou dopravu mezi několika klíčovými městy. Lidé by se měli snadněji dostávat do zaměstnání a zpět, víte jak jsou dneska mladí lidé nároční a pohodlní.   

Ministerstvo si od toho slibuje ještě dramatičtější rozvoj našeho kraje, ze kterého budete mít prospěch přece i Vy a vaše firma.

Zdar kamaráde, jak je?
Viděl jsem ty nové vlaky, co jsi nakoupil, a to je teda úplně jiná káva než ty staré usupěné vykopávky na páru. Doteď pamatuju, jak jsi začínal s prvním vlakem, takovým chudáčkem, a byl jsi vůbec rád, že máš na jeho provoz.

Někde jsem dokonce četl, že tyhle nové vlaky umí na rovince letět až %1 %2, možná i víc. Ptal jsem se jednoho mašinfíry a ten říkal, že to asi možné je, ale na to je třeba kvalitní podloží kolejí a dostatečně dlouhá rovinka. A na těch kouscích, co ty vlaky tady jezdí, to prej ani nemůžou vyzkoušet...

Zdravím příteli,
Příští rok pořádáme tradiční výstavu historických lokomotiv, bohužel firma, která nám je měla zapůjčit, nám to z neznámých důvodů odřekla. Jestli neseženeme náhradu, z výstavy nic nebude. 

Vaše firma má stále v provozu i staré vlaky, že? Velmi by nám pomohlo, pokud byste nám na tu výstavu mohl od každého typu jeden půjčit. Největší zájem máme samozřejmě o ty parní. Případně před nějakou dobou se prodával 460 Porter ve velice raritní úpravě - Red dwarf. V té době prý za směšnou cenu, nevíte náhodou, kdo jej nakonec odkoupil? O ten bychom měli velký zájem.

Řekněme, že mám ze své pozice o hodně větší možnosti jak se Vám odvděčit. Chtěl bych Vám nabídnout do užívání naši chloubu, lokomotivu 872 Sasha j. Z celkem vyrobených 601 kusů je tato právě ta poslední, ta šetsetprvá. Považuji za nutnost, abyste tento dar ode mne a mé společnosti přijal.

Dobré ráno pane řediteli,

Do tendru vypsaného vládou na vybudování elektráren se přihlásilo velké množství zahraničních investorů. Podle zástupce jedné z nadnárodních společností je letos zájem o energetické projekty enormní. 
Počítá se s rozšířením výstavby dalších bloků elektráren. Nové bloky nyní prochází testováním, první elektřinu by měly do sítě dodat ještě letos. 

Elektrárny samozřejmě spotřebují obrovské množství paliva, ať už jde o uhlí, nebo ropu. My máme vybudovanou velkou železniční síť a s přepravou uhlí a ropy máme již dlouholeté zkušenosti.

Měli bychom ze současné situace vytěžit co nejvíce.

Podle posledních propočtů mají elektrárny dostatek výkonu k pokrytí dodávek jak do domácností a firem, tak i k napájení našich nových elekrických vlaků. 

Navíc jsme získali i cenné zdroje pro další elektrifikaci tratí.

Dobrý den,

z pozice hejtmana našeho kraje mám pro Vás a vaši společnost nabídku k obchodu.

Naše města rostou čím dál rychleji. Okolní pole, kde se ještě nedávno pěstovaly zemědělské plodiny, se postupně mění v obytné čtvrti, industriální zóny a silnice. Zároveň stoupá poptávka a tak se potraviny, především obilí a maso, musí dovážet z čím dál větších vzdáleností.

Pracujeme proto na řešení. S několika většími farmáři již máme předběžnou smlouvu na dodávky a po Vás bychom chtěli zajištění logistiky od nich k nám do měst.

Dobré ráno pane řediteli,

nevím jestli se to k vám doneslo, ale YouWing Oil co. končí. Raketový vzestup a stejně rychlý pád jedné z nejvlivnějších společností v kraji. Sledoval jsem jejich četné obchodní úspěchy, ale že po pár letech skončí v dluzích, to čekal opravdu málokdo. 

Proč to ale zmiňuji je samotná likvidace firmy. Jejich majetek se bude rozprodávat a když jsem si prošel inventář, bylo by tam pár pro nás zajímavých položek. Kupříkladu položka 420A, tedy vlaková souprava s 2 lokomotivami a několika vagony na ropu. A ta cena není úplně špatná.

Dobrý den,

V depu %0 staví naši inženýři vlakovou soupravu pro MiningComp South. Standardně tyto vlaky dopravují uhlí na velké vzdálenosti, v našich končinách téměř nepředstavitelné.
Spolupráce s touto těžební společností by nám do budoucna mohla přinést více pobídek k přepravě a možná i otevření nových těžebních míst tady v našem kraji. 

Před dodáním je ale potřeba provoz tak dlouhého vlaku vyzkoušet.

Pro test určitě připojte i nějaké vagony a ideálně další lokomotivu, pokud ho plánujete naložit naplno. Běžně se používají až tři lokomotivy k dosažení požadovaných parametrů.

Je také třeba s mašinfírou probrat trasu, nezapomínejte, že naše nádraží na tohle nejsou stavěná.

Dobrý den,

Rád Vás poznávám a oceňuji, že jste si na mě udělal čas. 
Chtěl bych s vámi probrat možnost menší investice. Plánujeme obnovit provoz staré sklárny a původní tradici ruční výroby skla. Koupili jsme starou sklářskou budovu a mám za sebou také schopné lidi, skláře s mnohaletou zkušeností, dá se říci mistry v oboru. 

Bohužel nemáme dostatek peněz na rozjetí výroby. Stačilo by nám %0 na opravy a zaplacení lidí na prvních pár měsíců. 

Nechtěl byste nám s tím pomoci?

Vážíme si Vaší důvěry v naše schopnosti. Uděláme vše, aby sklárna prosperovala a vaše investice se mohla zúročit.

Počítám, že tak do roku budeme již plně schopní zásobovat okolní obchody.

Dobrý den,

Rád vás vidím a po roce mám dobré zprávy. Výroba se rozjela a uzavřeli jsme smlouvu s prvním odběratelem, zatím tedy pouze malým. Stále hledáme nějaké větší odběratele a obchodní řetězce. 

Bohužel celý projekt potřebuje mnoho peněz, o něco více než jsme předpokládali. Půjdu přímo k věci, nechcete do nás investovat další finanční prostředky? Nabízím Vám za to větší podíl ve firmě. Počáteční investice nám velmi pomohla do začátku, bohužel náklady na marketing a získání velkých zakázek jsou veliké.

Výborně!
S tak velkým partnerem za zády se nám jistě podaří získat větší odběratele a výrobu (a s ní i hodnotu Vašeho podílu ve firmě) znásobit. Pro společnost jako je ta Vaše možná investice nepředstavuje kdovíjak velkou položku, ale věřte, že jste pomohl pár lidem plnit sny. Sklářská výroba existovala v oblasti již ve 14. století a vy jste se zasloužil, aby jen tak neskončila.

S jedním partnerem domlouváme také zakázkovou výrobu skla do jejich jídelních vagonů. Někdy vás musím seznámit, je stejný nadšenec do vlaků jako vy.

Rozumím. I tak si velice vážíme vašich peněz, pokusíme se sehnat další prostředky na provoz půjčkou. Budu holt muset vytáhnotu svůj nejlepší svetr a obejít pár bank.

Naše Výroba běží samozřejmě nadále, o svoji investici nemusíte mít strach. Zrovna včera jsem domluvil pár menších obchodů co nám pokryjí náklady minimálně do dalšího měsíce.

Pokud byste chtěl vaši investici zpět, máme dostatek prostředků k vyplacení. Samozřejmě budeme rádi, pokud s námi jako společník zůstanete i nadále. 

Máme také zájem o vaše železniční služby, hlavně o přepravu sklářského písku a rozvoz zboží do obchodů.

Sháním dodavatele písku pro naši sklárnu a v okolních dolech je podle všeho písek velice kvalitní a dá se ve sklářství použít. I proto měla v našem kraji výroba skla vždy takovou tradici.

Ve sklárně ale písek pomalu dochází a i pro rozšíření výroby bude potřeba se pořádně zásobit. Proto bych po Vás potřeboval dovézt z okolních dolů větší množství písku. Skladovací prostory jsem už nachystal, můžeme začít vpodstatě ihned. Zároveň byste nám mohl pomoci i se zavážením obchodů ve městech.

Zdravím vás příteli.
Výroba skla jede na plné obrátky a písku máme dostatek, možná i na rok provozu. Bez vás bychom to přepravili jen stěží, doteď tomu nemůžu uvěřit a máte naše nehynoucí díky.

Několik zájemců projevilo zájem o odkup naší sklárny. Náš základní požadavek byl, že i po případné akvizici chceme fungovat samostatně a takové záruky nám dává jen jednatel od Glossy Glasses. Mají vážný zájem o sklárnu a jako jediní přistoupili na naše podmínky.

Durch die neuesten Entdeckungen in der Metallurgie und die geplante Öffnung der ersten Gießerei in dieser Region sind unsere Ingenieure kurz davor, große Fortschritte in der Dampfmaschinenentwicklung zu machen.

Sie werden bald die Fähigkeit haben, schnellere und größere Dampflokomotiven zu bauen. Alles was sie brauchen, um ihre jahrelange Arbeit zu vollenden, sind Ressourcen.

Ich grüße dich, mein Sohn,

unserer kleine Gemeinde fehlt ein Ort zum Schutz und für Gebete. Von der Kommune haben wir eine alte, verfallene Kirche erstanden, welche wir herrichten wollen. Unsere Anhänger werden uns helfen, aber wir brauchen Material. Deswegen wollten wir dich um Hilfe bitten. Wir haben einen Teil unserer Kollekte gesammelt. Es ist nicht viel, aber vielleicht reicht es.

Der Ruf der Firma hat sich herumgesprochen, so dass wir mehrere Anfragen auf dem Tisch liegen haben. Leider können wir nicht alle erfüllen. Von all den Möglichkeiten habe ich die beiden Interessantesten ausgewählt.

Es sind:

Entgegen des anfänglichen Misstrauens vom Besitzer der lokalen Gießerei uns gegenüber, haben wir es geschafft einen wichtigen Vertrag mit ihm abzuschliessen. Der Transport von Eisengußblöcken von diesen Gießereien ist immernoch unser grösstes Projekt. Vielleicht brauchen wir ein paar zusätzliche Züge oder müssen unsere Stationen ausbauen. Diese Investionen werden sich allerdings lohnen.

Chef,

warum kaufen wir immer noch diese alten, klapprigen Loks? Es gibt jetzt viel bessere, schnellere Loks da draussen. Wir müssen ein bischen was investieren, aber ich bin mir sicher das Herr Eteborrow eine Förderung verhandeln kann. Vielleicht eine Subvention vom Staat oder sowas?

Mein Freund, ich habe das starke Gefühl, dass du in den letzten paar Monaten einfach zu hart gearbeitet hast und mal ne Pause machen solltest.

Dein Zugimperium läuft gut, weißt du, aber du solltest von Zeit zu Zeit mal ne wohlverdiente Pause einlegen. Steig in einen deiner modernen Züge und genieß eins der berühmten Sandwiches in einem der Speisewagen oder mach eine Tour mit einem deiner erfahrenen Lokführer. Egal was, mach einfach eine Pause und genieße die wundervolle Landschaft aus dem dahinrollenden Zug.

Guten Tag,
wie Sie vielleicht wissen, sind wir in diesem Jahrzehnt mit Diesellokomotiven auf den Markt gegangen, die dem neusten Stand der Technik entsprechen. Im Moment stellen wir eine verbesserte Version unserer 52 fertig und wollen Sie unter Betriebsbedingungen testen. Während die Unterhaltskosten gleich geblieben sind, konnten wir mehr Leistung und eine bessere Höchstgeschwindigkeit erzielen. Mit diesen Parametern ist sie ideal, um Passagiere auf längeren Strecken zu befördern.

Da unsere Lokomotiven aktuell in Benutztung sind, wollen wir Ihnen useren Prototypen 52+ zum Test zur Verfügung stellen. Wie gesagt ist sie am Besten für den Passagiertransport geeignet. Wenn alles klappt, geben wir Ihnen eine weitere 52+ Lokomotive für Testzwecke kostenfei dazu.

Also? Sind sie dabei?

Vor einer Weile haben wir gemeinsam den Vertrag zur Öllieferung abgeschlossen und ich würde gern daran anknüpfen. Wir müssen eine Lösung für die Beförderung von Petroleum und Chemikalien aus unseren Rafinerien finden. Die meisten anderen Transportunternehmen in dieser Gegend haben einfach keine ausreichenden Kapazitäten!

Unsere Lager sind stellenweise so voll, dass wir die Produktion stoppen müssen. Das kostet uns so viel Geld, das können Sie sich kaum vorstellen. Ich will nicht länger Unterhaltskosten für eine Rafinierie zahlen müssen, die nichts produziert. Da wäre es besser sie stattdessen ganz zu schließen.

Seit mehreren Jahren haben unsere Wissenschaftler ihr Bestes gegeben um die Luftverschmutzung durch den Betrieb unserer Fahrzeugflotte in den Städten zu reduzieren und gleichzeitig unsere heutigen Züge so ökologisch wie möglich zu gestalten. Nach einigen fehlgeschlagenen Versuchen mit Galvanischen Zellen und unabhängigen Antrieben ist nun endlich der erste Prototyp für eine Oberleitung skizziert worden. Schon bald werden wir die erste elektrisch angetriebene Lokomotive nutzen können.

Das wird viele Vorteile mit sich bringen, egal ob ökologisch oder ökonomisch. Aber zuerst müssen wir den Prototypen fertigstellen und anschließend das erste elektrifizierte Gleis bauen.
Die Investitionen dazu werden alles andere als klein sein aber sie werden uns einen enormen technologischen Vorsprung sichern.

Mein Herr, ein Geschäftsmann von Trans and Cargo hat sich mit einem Angebot an mich gewendet. Er hat eine alte Dampflok zu verkaufen. Zufällig weiß ich genau, worum es sich dabei handelt. Die alte Porter hat nach einer Ausstellung für viele Jahre in einem alten Depot gestanden. Ich schätze er weiß nicht, was er damit jetzt noch anfangen soll. Sie ist ein wunderschöner Veteran aber was soll wir mit diesem alten Wrack in unserer Firma?

Es handelt sich um eine modifizierte Version einer 2-6-0 aber sie scheint für uns eher uninteressant, vor allem zu diesem Preis.

Das ist eine tolle Lokomotive, daran gibt es keinen Zweifel, aber wir müssen damit auch Geld verdienen können.
Hoffentlich hast du dafür einen Plan im Kopf.
In der Zwischenzeit werde ich sie in eines unserer Depots bringen und methodisch durchchecken.

Wir haben uns irgendwie schon daran gewöhnt, an der Lokomotive vorbeizulaufen, die hinter dem oberen Depot steht und in den letzten Wintern einiges an Rost angesetzt hat.
Unseren Unterlagen nach, gehört sie uns nicht aber es kommt auch Niemand, um sie für sich zu beanspruchen...
Es wäre doch eine Schande sie so verkommen zu lassen, oder?

Hallo,

ich bin der Inhaber einer örtlichen Stahlschmiede. Wir arbeiten bereits seit eim paar Jahren mit der südwestlichen Mine zusammen und haben die Sandlieferungen nach und nach gelagert. Wie dem auch sei, hat sich unser Fertigungsprozess für Siliziumstahl weiterentwickelt und und wir sind nun in der Lage wesentlich mehr Stahl zu proudzieren und dabei weniger Sand zu verbrauchen. Die Nachfrage nach unserem Stahl steigt und wir sind nicht mehr in der Lage, den Stahl selbst an alle umliegenden Fabriken zu liefern. Ich habe also ein Angebot für Sie.

Sie werden einige Rohstoffe brauchen, darunter Sand, um Gußformen zu erstellen und Quartz, um den Stahl zu verfeinern.
Es gibt hier allerdings nicht viele Vorkommen, also müssen Sie sie so effizient wie möglich nutzen.

Guten Tag mein Herr,
es ist schon eine Weile her, seit wir zusammen an der Beschaffung von Subventionen vom Ministerium für Industrie und Handel gearbeitet haben. Heute allerdings möchte ich Ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf eine andere Gelegenheit lenken.

Es ziehen immer mehr Firmen und junge Leute in unsere Region. Das Ministerium hat beschlossen, die Nützlichkeit der Eisenbahn zu steigern und eine Stammlinie für das schnelle Reisen zwischen verschiedenen Schlüsselstädten zu errichten. Die Leute sollen leichter zwischen ihrer Arbeit und ihrem Wohnort hin und her reisen können. Sie wissen ja, wie fordernd und bequem junge Menschen heutzutage sein können.

Das Ministerium hofft auf eine noch dramatischere Entwicklung unserer Region und Ihre Firma wird davon mit Sicherheit ebenfalls profitieren.

Hey Kumpel, wie läuft's?
Ich hab die neuen Züge gesehen, die du gekauft hast und die sind ja eine ganz andere Liga als die alten schäbigen Dampfzüge. Ich kann mich noch erinnern, wie du mit dem ersten Zug angefangen hast, so ein armseeliges Ding und du warst froh, dass du noch etwas Geld für Treibstoff übrig hattest.

Ich hab irgendwo gelesen, dass diese neuen Züge mit %1 %2 oder mehr dahinfliegen können. Ich habe einen der Lokführer gefragt und er meinte, dass es möglich wäre, dafür bräuchte man aber eine laaaange gerade Strecke von hoher Qualität. Und auf unseren schrecklich lausigen Gleisen, bräuchten sie das gar nicht erst versuchen...

Hallo mein Freund,
nächstes Jahr wird eine traditionelle Ausstellung historischer Lokomotiven stattfinden. Unglücklicherweise hat das Unternehmen, das uns die Lokomotiven sonst immer ausgeliehen hat, uns für dieses Jahr ohne Begründung eine Absage erteilt. Wenn wir keinen Ersatz finden, wird es in den Schaukästen nichts zu bestaunen geben.

Dein Unternehmen betreibt doch diese alten Züge immernoch oder? Es wäre wirklich sehr hilfreich, wenn du uns eine Lokomotive jeden Typs am Tag der Ausstellung zur Verfügung stellen könntest. Natürlich sind wir hauptsächlich an Dampfloks interessiert. Es wurden mal ein paar 460er Porter in einer einer seltenen Version namens \"Roter Zwerg\" verkauft. Du weißt nicht zufällig wer so eine gekauft haben könnte. An so einer wären wir ganz besonders interessiert.

Guten Morgen Chef,

Eine beträchtliche Anzahl ausländischer Investoren haben sich auf die Ausschreibung der Regierung zur Errichtung neuer Stromkraftwerke gemeldet. Einem Abgesandten einer der internationalen Unternehmen nach, ist die Anzahl der Projekte bezogen auf elektrische Energie dieses Jahr enorm. Es ist geplant die bestehenden Stromkraftwerke zu erweitern. Einige der neuen Abschnitte werden sogar bereits getestet. Der erste Strom sollte noch dieses Jahr durchs Netzwerk fließen. 

Natürlich verbrauchen Stromkraftwerke eine enorme Menge an Treibstoff, sei es in Form von Kohle oder Öl. Wir haben ein Eisenbahnnetzwerk und viele Jahre Erfahrung beim Transport von Kohle und Öl.

Gemäß der letzten Berechnungen erzeugen die Kraftwerke genug Strom, um sowohl die Nachfrage der Wohnhäuser als auch der Geschäfte decken zu können. Zusätzlich können unsere neuen elektrischen Züge durch sie angetrieben werden.

Darüber hinaus haben wir einige wertvolle Rohstoffe für die weitere Elektrifizierung unserer Strecken bekommen.

Hallo,

als Gouverneur unserer Region habe ich Ihnen und Ihrer Firma ein Geschäft anzubieten.

Unsere Städt wachsen immer schneller. Die Felder in der Umgebung, auf denen vor Kurzem noch Getreide angebaut wurde, werden nach und nach zu Wohnflächen, Industriegebieten und Straßen umgewandelt. Im selben Moment aber wächst die Nachfrage nach Lebensmitteln und wir müssen diese von immer weiter weg importieren.
Wir arbeiten bereits an einer Lösung. Dazu haben wir Versorgungsverträge mit einigen großen Bauernhöfen abgeschlossen und möchten Sie darum bitten, die Logistik zwischen den Höfen und unseren Städten zu übernehmen.

Chef,

es ist prima, dass wir die Möglichkeit haben, neue elektrische Lokomotiven zu kaufen aber wir haben nicht genug elektrifizierte Strecken, um sie nutzen zu können. Wir müssen einen Großteil unserers Streckennetzes elektrifizieren, mindestens aber die Hauptstrecken. Das wird sicher nicht leicht aber es wird sich am Ende für uns auszahlen.

Guten Morgen Chef,

ich weiß nicht, ob Sie es schon gehört haben aber YouWing Oil hat den Bankrott erklären müssen. Ein kometenhafter Aufstieg und eni ebenso schneller Fall einer der einflussreichsten Unternehmen des Landes. Ich habe ihre zahlreichen Geschäftserfolge gesehen und kaum jemand hätte gedacht, dass das ein paar Jahre später in Schulden enden würde.

Aber warum ich das überhaupt erwähne, ist die Auflösung des Unternehmens selbst. Der Firmenbesitz steht zum Verkauf und als ich das letzte Mal einen Blick auf den Bestand geworden habe, gab es da noch einige interessante Dinge für uns. Zum Beispiel Listenpunkt 420A, ein Zugsatz mit 2 Lokomotiven und diversen Ölwaggons. Und der Preis kann sich wirklich sehen lassen.

Wir haben unsere Leute den kompletten Zug inspizieren lassen und die Waggons sind in schlechterem Zustand als wir erwartet haben. Zusätzlich haben sie das YouWing Oil Logo, das für unsere Kunden nicht gerade das beste Zeichen ist. Wahrscheinlich ist es das nicht wert, die Waggons zu restaurieren und lackieren sondern es wäre besser sie zu verkaufen. Aber die Lokomotiven werden auf jeden Fall nützlich sein.

Hallo,

unsere Ingenieure bauen einen neuen Zug für die MiningComp South. Normalerweise transportieren diese Züge Kohle über große Entfernungen, fast unvorstellbar in unserem Land.
Eine Zusammenarbeit mit dieser Bergbaufirma könnte uns weitere Transportanreize in der Zukunft verschaffen und vielleicht zur Eröffnung von Minen hier in unserer Region sorgen.

Wie dem auch sei, es ist nötig, dass wir den Betrieb eines so langen Zuges testen, bevor er ausgeliefert wird.

Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie einige Waggons und idealerweise eine weitere Lokomotive für diesen Test verbinden. Vor allem dann, wenn Sie vorhaben ihn voll zu beladen. In der Regel sind bis zu drei Lokomotiven erforderlich, um die gewünschten Parameter zu erreichen.

Es ist ebenfalls erforderlich, die Route mit dem Fahrer zu besprechen. Bedenken Sie, dass unsere Bahnhöfe dafür nicht ausgelegt sind.

Ich mache mir langsam etwas Sorgen, dass das keine besonders gute Idee war.

Guten Tag mein Herr,

es ist mir ein Vergnügen, Sie kennenzulernen und vielen Dank für Ihre Zustimmung zu einem Treffen.
Ich möchte gern die Möglichkeit einer kleinen Investition besprechen. Wir planen eine alte Glaserei und die lange Tradition der Glasproduktion in unserer Region wiederherzustellen. Wir haben eine alte Glaserei gekauft und ich habe hier ein paar fähige Leute, Glaser mit vielen Jahren Erfahrung, Meister ihres Fachs.

Leider haben wir noch nicht genug Geld um die Produktion zu starten. Unseren Berechnungen nach, sollten %0 genug sein, um die Glaserei zu reparieren und die Glaser für die ersten paar Monate zu bezahlen.

Würden Sie uns dabei helfen?

Guten Tag mein Herr,

gut Sie wiederzusehen. Ein Jahr war eine ziemlich lange Zeit aber ich habe gute Neuigkeiten. Die Produktion ist angelaufen und wir haben einen Vertag mit unserem ersten Kunden unterschrieben, auch wenn es vorerst nur ein kleiner Kunde ist. Wir sind noch auf der Suche nach größeren Kunden und Vertriebsketten.

Leider braucht das gesamte Projekt eine Menge Geld, etwas mehr, als wir erwartet haben. Ich will direkt zum Punkt kommen: Wollen Sie mehr Geld in uns investieren? Ich biete Ihnen einen größeren Anteil an der Firma an. Die anfängliche Investition hat uns zu Beginn gut geholfen aber leider sind die Kosten der Akquise großer Aufträge wesentlich höher.

Mit solch einem großen Partner an Bord werden wir sicherlich mehr Kunden anziehen und die Produktion (und damit den Wert Ihrer Anteile an der Glaserei) erhöhen können. Für so ein Unternehmen wie Ihres ist das nicht besonders viel Geld aber vertrauen Sie mir, sie haben ein paar Leuten geholfen, ihren Traum zu verwirklichen. In diesem Gebiet wurde Glas bereits seit dem 14. Jahrhundert hergestellt und dank Ihnen wird diese Kunst auch nicht so bald verschwinden.

Aktuell besprechen wir mit einem Geschäftspartner die speziell angefertigen Scheiben für deren Speisewaggons. Ich muss Sie mit ihm bekannt machen, er ist genau so ein Zugliebhaber wie Sie.

Ich verstehe. Trotzem rechnen wir Ihnen ihre erste Investition sehr hoch an. Wir werden versuchen mehr Geld durch einen Kredit zu bekommen. Ich muss zuerst meinen besten Pullover anziehen und dann bei ein paar Banken nachfragen.

Natürlich geht unsere Produktion weiter, Sie müssen sich keine Sorgen um Ihre Investition machen. Gerade gestern konnte ich zum Beispiel Geschäfte mit ein paar kleineren Läden abschließen, das sollte uns zumindest über den nächsten Monat helfen.

Ich suche nach einem Lieferanten für Sand für unsere Glaserei und der Sand aus den umliegenden Minen scheint von guter Qualität zu sein, also können wir ihn in der Glasindustrie einsetzen. Das ist ebenfalls einer der Gründe, warum die Glasherstellung in unserer Region so eine lange Tradition hat.

Wie dem auch sei, geht in unserer Glaserei der Sand langsam zur Neige und es ist für uns absolut wichtig, eine gute Versorgung sicherzustellen, auch um unsere Produktion auszuweiten. Deshalb möchte ich Sie bitten, mehr Sand aus den umliegenden Minen zu liefern. Ich habe den Lagerplatz bereits eingerichtet, also können wir sofort loslegen.

Grüße mein Freund.

Die Glasherstellung läuft auf Hochtouren und wir haben genug Sand, vielleicht sogar für eine ganze Jahresproduktion. Ohne Sie wäre das nahezu unmöglich zu erreichen gewesen. Ich kann es noch nicht ganz fassen und Ihnen gebührt unser ewiger Dank.

Einige Unternehmen haben ihr Interesse ausgedrückt unsere Glaserei zu kaufen. Unsere grundlegende Bedingung war es, dass wir unabhängig bleiben, auch nach der Übernahmen. Nur Glossy Glasses Vorstand gab uns diese Garantien. Sie haben ein ernsthaftes Interesse an der Glaserei und sie sind die einzigen, die unsere Verhandlungsbedingungen akzeptiert haben.

У меня... у нас появилась большая проблема. Наша компания инвестировала значительные средства в технологию лесозаготовок. Ваша компания едва доставляет половину того, что могут обрабатывать наши лесопилки.

Мы требуем, чтобы вы увеличили доставку брёвен по крайней мере на половину мощностей наших лесопилок.

Несмотря на первоначальное недоверие местного литейщика, мы договорились с ним о важном контракте. Перевозка железных слитков с его литейных заводов по-прежнему является нашим самым большим проектом.

Мой друг, у меня есть ощущение, что последние несколько месяцев вы работали слишком усердно, и вам нужно сделать перерыв.

Ваша железнодорожная империя отлично работает, и вы это знаете. Но вы должны время от времени отдыхать. Сядьте в один из ваших современных поездов, попробуйте знаменитый бутерброд в вагоне-ресторане или прокатитесь с одним из ваших опытных машинистов. Просто сделайте перерыв и насладитесь прекрасной сельской местностью из окна скоростного поезда.

Добрый день,
Как вы, наверное, знаете, в этом десятилетии мы вывели на рынок самые современные дизельные локомотивы. В настоящее время мы заканчиваем обновленную версию наших Bdz 52, которые уже на стадии тестирования. При сохранении тех же эксплуатационных затрат нам удалось добиться более высокой мощности и увеличенной максимальной скорости. Благодаря этим параметрам, он идеально подходит для перевозки пассажиров на более длинных маршрутах.

Поскольку наши локомотивы уже в эксплуатации, мы хотим предложить наш прототип Bdz 52+ для тестирования. Как я уже сказал, его лучше всего использовать для перевозки пассажиров. Если все пройдёт успешно, мы предоставим вам еще несколько тестовых локомотивов Bdz 52+. Вам он достанется бесплатно.

Вы в деле?

Ого, на этот раз у меня действительно потрясающие новости! Из кругов, близких к министру промышленности, я узнал, что недавно было обнаружено небольшое месторождение черного золота - нефть!

Государственные субсидии не заставили себя долго ждать, и министерство уже привлекает инвесторов для начала добычи. Конечно, будет много вкладчиков, и, если не останемся в стороне, мы сможем извлечь из этого немалую прибыль. 

С развитием нефтехимической промышленности в нашем регионе в качестве источника топлива, есть смысл вложить средства в дизельные локомотивы для наших поездов. Это потребует первоначальных инвестиций, но это беспроигрышное дело.

Некоторое время назад у нас был контракт на перевозку нефти, и я хочу его возобновить. Нам нужно найти решение для транспортировки нефтепродуктов и химикатов с наших нефтеперерабатывающих заводов. Большинство судоходных компаний полностью недееспособны.

Наши хранилища периодически настолько переполнены, что мы вынуждены останавливать производство, и вы не представляете, скольких денег нам это стоит. Я не собираюсь оплачивать затраты на нефтеперерабатывающий завод, когда он ничего не производит, уж лучше его закрыть.

Сэр, бизнесмен из Trans &amp; Cargo связался со мной с предложением. У них есть старый паровоз для продажи. Кстати, я очень хорошо знаю, о чем речь. Портер хранится в старом депо уже много лет, с какой-то выставки. Я думаю, они не знают, куда его деть. Это прекрасный ветеран, но что мы будем делать с этой развалиной в нашей компании?

Это модифицированная версия 2-6-0, но, похоже, она не интересна для нас, особенно за такую сумму денег.

Здравствуйте,

Как владелец местных сталелитейных заводов, я сотрудничал в течение нескольких лет с юго-западным рудником, и мы некоторое время хранили несколько вагонов для перевозки песка. Тем не менее, наш процесс производства кремнистой стали продвинулся, и теперь мы можем производить гораздо больше стали с использованием меньшего количества кварца (песка). Спрос на нашу сталь растет, и мы больше не успеваем доставлять её на окружающие фабрики, поэтому у меня есть предложение для вас.

Вы, по слухам, являетесь способным бизнесменом. Слышал, вам не хватает %0. Если мы заключим сделку, я дам вам определенную сумму %0 прямо сейчас или пару лишних вагонов для перевозки песка, и вы поможете мне поставками сырья на мои сталелитейные заводы, а затем поставками стали на местные заводы. Что скажете?

Хорошего дня, сэр,
Прошло много времени с нашего последнего сотрудничества по получению субсидий от Министерства промышленности и торговли. Сегодня, я хотел бы снова обратить ваше внимание на новую возможность.

Все больше и больше компаний и молодых людей переезжают в наш регион. Министерство решило улучшить положение и построить магистральную линию для быстрого сообщения, между несколькими ключевыми городами. Людям должно быть проще перемещаться между работой и домом. Вы знаете, как молодые люди сейчас требуют комфортных условий.

Министерство надеется на еще более динамичное развитие нашего региона, и ваша компания также выиграет от этого.

Я видел новые поезда, которые вы купили, и это совершенно другая лига, чем старые дрянные паровые. Я помню, как вы начинали с первым поездом, таким убогим, и вы были рады сэкономить несколько монет на топливе.

Я где-то читал, что эти новые поезда могут летать %1 %2  а может и больше. Я спросил знакомого машиниста, и он сказал, что это возможно, но для этого ему нужен высокоскоростной прямой путь, а на наших извилистых дерьмовых рельсах он даже не рискнёт...

Привет друг,
В следующем году мы проводим традиционную выставку исторических локомотивов. К сожалению, компания, которая их предоставляет, отказала нам без каких-либо причин. Если мы не получим замену, нам будет нечего показать.

Ваша компания все еще использует эти старые поезда, верно? Было бы очень здорово, если бы вы могли предоставить нам один локомотив каждого типа на день выставки. Конечно, нас в основном интересуют паровозы. В конце концов, около 460 Портеров были проданы в очень редкой версии под названием «Красный карлик». Вы случайно не знаете, кто его купил?

Доброе утро, шеф,

Много иностранных инвесторов приняли участие в государственном тендере на строительство электростанций. По словам представителя одной из международных компаний, электроэнергетические проекты в этом году колоссальны.
Планируется расширить действующие блоки электростанций. Некоторые из них уже проходят испытания. Первое электричество должно появиться в сети в этом году.

Конечно, электростанции потребляют огромное количество топлива, будь то уголь или нефть. У нас большая железнодорожная сеть и многолетний опыт транспортировки угля и нефти.

Должен заметить, что это именно ликвидация компании. Их имущество будет выставлено на продажу, и, когда я проверил активы, нашел несколько интересных позиций. Например пункт 420А, поезд, состоящий из двух локомотивов и нескольких вагонов. И цена очень хорошая.

Привет,

Наши инженеры строят новый поезд для компании MiningCroft. Обычно эти поезда перевозят уголь на большие расстояния, практически невообразимые в нашей стране.
Сотрудничество с этой горнодобывающей компанией может дать нам больше стимулов для транспортировки в будущем и, возможно, открытия новых горнодобывающих предприятий здесь, в нашем регионе.

Однако перед доставкой необходимо проверить работу такого длинного поезда.

Не забудьте подцепить несколько вагонов и, в идеале, еще один локомотив для этого теста. Особенно, если вы планируете его полностью загрузить. Для достижения желаемых параметров обычно используется до трех локомотивов.

Также необходимо обсудить маршрут с машинистом, помните, что наши станции не рассчитаны на такую длину.

Добрый день, сэр,

Приятно познакомиться и большое спасибо за встречу.
Я хотел бы обсудить возможность небольших инвестиций.  Мы планируем восстановить старый стекольный завод, как и многолетнюю традицию производства стекла в нашем регионе.  Мы купили старое здание стекольного завода, и у меня также есть несколько способных людей, стеклодувов, с большим опытом, гуру в этом деле.

К сожалению, у нас пока недостаточно денег, чтобы начать производство. Согласно расчетам, нам достаточно %0, для ремонта стеклодувного цеха и оплаты мастерам нескольких первых месяцев.

Приятно видеть вас снова. Год был чертовски долгим, но у меня хорошие новости. Производство наладилось, и мы подписали контракт с первым заказчиком, пока только небольшим. Мы по прежнему ищем крупных клиентов и розничные сети.

К сожалению, проект требует больше денег, чем мы ожидали. Я сразу перейду к делу - вы хотите увеличить инвестиции в наш бизнес? Я предлагаю вам большую долю в компании.

С таким крупным партнером нам, безусловно, удастся привлечь больше клиентов и увеличить производство (и, соответственно, размер вашей доли в стекольном заводе). Для такой компании, как ваша, это совсем немного, но, поверьте мне, вы помогли нескольким людям осуществить свои мечты. Производство стекла в этом районе существовало с начала 14-го века, и, благодаря вам, оно никуда не исчезнет в ближайшее время.

В настоящее время мы обсуждаем с одним из заказчиков оконные стекла для их вагонов-ресторанов. Я должен познакомить вас с ним, он такой же энтузиаст поездов, как и вы.

Мы также заинтересованы в ваших транспортных услугах, в основном для перевозки кварцевого песка, а затем и для доставки нашей продукции в местные магазины.

Я ищу поставщика песка для наших стекольных заводов, и, кажется, песок в близлежащих карьерах достаточно качественный, и мы сможем использовать его в стекольной промышленности. Это как раз та причина, почему производство стекла всегда было в нашей области доброй традицией.

Однако, песок в наших цехах постепенно истощается, а для расширения производства нам необходимо обеспечить себя хорошим запасом. Поэтому я бы попросил вас доставить больше песка из близлежащих карьеров. Я уже подготовил склад и мы можем начать немедленно. Вы также можете помочь нам с поставками нашей продукции в городские магазины.

Приветствую, мой друг.

Производство стекла идет полным ходом, а запасов песка уже хватит, наверное, на целый год. Без вас было бы трудно достичь таких результатов. Пока я до сих пор не могу поверить в это, а вы достойны нашей вечной благодарности.

Несколько компаний выразили заинтересованность в покупке нашего стекольного завода. Нашим базовым требованием было то, что мы хотим оставаться независимыми даже после приобретения. Только владелец Glossy Glasses дал нам такие гарантии. У них серьезный интерес к стекольному заводу, и они единственные, кто согласен на наши условия.

Soy un hombre ocupado, no tengo tiempo que perder.

La demanda de carbón en las fábricas de herramientas está aumentando. Tengo varias minas ricas en minerales. Quiero que lo transportes a ellas lo antes posible. No me importa cómo. No lo lamentarás.

A por ello.

Los recientemente descubiertos depósitos de hierro son muy prometedores. Las fundiciones ya tienen apoyo del estado para procesar más mena y convertir en hierro, pero éste no se va a mover sólo...

Déjame contarte algo. Mis fundiciones están yendo a pérdida porque el obseso de %1 nos está quitando el negocio. Y esto es tu culpa, descubrí que tú eres su principal distribuidor.

Puedo compartir contigo ciertos avances tecnológicos, y a cambio quiero que me hagas un favor. Necesito que dejes de entregarle mena a su fundición. Piénsalo antes de discutir, te estoy ofreciendo bastante.

Amigo mío, tengo una fuerte sensación de que te has pasado los últimos meses trabajando demasiado duro y necesitas tomar un descanso.

Tu imperio ferroviario está yendo de maravilla, lo sabes, pero deberías tomarte un merecido descanso de vez en cuando. Aborda uno de tus modernos trenes, prueba uno de los famosos platos de tus coches restaurantes, o acompaña a uno de tus hábiles maquinistas. Sólo toma un descanso y disfruta del paisaje desde un tren en movimiento.

¡Buenos días!
Como probablemente sepas, en estos últimos años hemos introducido al mercado varias locomotoras de última tecnología. En este preciso momento estamos terminando la versión mejorada de nuestro modelo 52, que ya estamos empezando a probar. Hemos conseguido obtener un mayor rendimiento y una mayor velocidad máxima manteniendo los mismos costos de operación. Creemos que éstas características son ideales para el transporte de pasajeros de larga distancia.

Como nuestras locomotoras de prueba ya están en funcionamiento, queremos ofrecerte una de nuestras 52+ para probarla en un régimen más intenso. Como te digo, sería ideal que la uses para transportar pasajeros. Si todo sale bien, en agradecimiento te regalaremos ésa y una más.

¿Qué dices?

Esta vez, tengo muy buenas noticias. Fuentes cercanas al Ministerio de la Industria dicen que recientemente se han descubierto pequeños depósitos de oro negro - ¡petróleo!

Poco después, el Ministerio comenzó a ofrecer subsidios para atraer a inversores y comenzar a explotar los depósitos. Es muy probable que haya más depósitos en la región, y, si participamos, podemos ganar bastante dinero. 

Con el desarrollo de la industria petroquímica en nuestra región, y la posibilidad de usar petróleo como combustible, tenemos razones para invertir en locomotiras diésel para nuestros trenes. La inversión inicial será muy cara, pero no podemos ignorar esta oportunidad.

Hace un tiempo estábamos tratando el contrato de transporte de petróleo crudo y ahora quisiera dar un paso más. Necesitamos transportar los petroquímicos producidos por nuestras refinerías. La mayoría de las empresas de transporte de por aquí no tienen la capacidad necesaria.

Nuestros almacenes suelen estar tan llenos que nos vemos obligados a detener la producción y eso nos cuesta sumas que ni te imaginas. Antes que pagar el costo innecesario de una refinería inactiva, prefiero cerrarla.

Desde hace varios años los científicos han estado haciendo un gran esfuerzo para reducir la contaminación producida por nuestro material rodante en las ciudades y convertir los transportes ferroviarios actuales en un medio más ecológico.

Después de muchos intentos fallidos con celdas galvánicas y tracción independiente, ya ha sido diseñado el primer prototipo de tracción eléctrica con catenaria aérea y pronto la primera locomotora de tracción eléctrica estará en funcionamiento.

Esto tiene todo tipo de beneficios, ya sean ecológicos o económicos. Pero primero necesitamos completar el prototipo y construir una vía electrificada. La inversión no será pequeña, pero tendremos una gran ventaja técnica.

Disculpe la intromisión, hemos recibido contacto de un directivo de Trans Cargo y quieren ofrecernos algo: Tienen una vieja locomotora de vapor para vender. De pura casualidad, sucede que sé de qué se trata: Es una vieja Porter que han tenido guardada en una cochera muchos años, desde una exposición ferroviaria. Creo que no saben qué hacer con ella. Es una hermosa pieza de maquinaria clásica, pero ¿Qué haríamos nosotros con ese viejo trasto?

Es una versión modificada del modelo 2-6-0 pero aún así no estoy seguro de que nos sirva de mucho, mucho menos por esa suma.

¡Hola!

Soy el propietario de una acería local, ya llevamos un par de años trabajando con la mina del sudoeste por lo que hemos acumulado bastantes vagones areneros. Sin embargo hemos mejorado nuestro proceso de fundición y ahora podemos producir mucho más acero con mucha menos arena de cuarzo. Al mismo tiempo nos ha crecido la demanda y ya no damos abasto para entregar los cargamentos a nuestros clientes, así que tengo una propuesta para hacerte.

Se dice que eres hábil para los negocios y estás necesitando un poco de %0. Puedo enviarte un poco de %0 ahora mismo, o puedo enviarte un par de vagones areneros que tenemos de sobra para que me ayudes primero abasteciendo de materia prima mi fundición y después entregando acero a mis clientes. ¿Qué te parece?

¡Buenos días!
Ya ha pasado bastante tiempo desde nuestro último esfuerzo por obtener un subsidio del Ministerio de Industria y Comercio. Hoy he decidido traer a tu atención esta nueva oportunidad.

Muchos jóvenes y muchas empresas se están mudando a esta región. El Ministerio ha decidido mejorar los servicios y construir una línea troncal de tránsito rápido entre varias ciudades clave. La gente necesita moverse fácilmente de casa al trabajo, y ya sabes lo exigentes que son los jóvenes de estos días con la calidad de los servicios.

El Ministerio espera un crecimiento dramático en esta región, y te puedes beneficiar bastante con él.

Estuve viendo esas locomotoras nuevas que compraste, y son de otro mundo comparadas a esos viejos trastos a vapor que tenías antes. Todavía me acuerdo de cuando empezaste con tu primer tren, que agradecías poder tener algunos centavos para el combustible.

Leí por algún lado que estas nuevas locomotoras pueden ir a %1 %2 o tal vez más. Le pregunté a uno de los maquinistas, y me dijo que sería posible, si pudieran correr sobre trechos rectos muuy largos de vías bien niveladas con rieles de alta calidad, pero en las tortuosas trazas de pobre calidad que tenemos, no tienen ni la oportunidad de intentarlo...

Hola camarada,
El año próximo estaremos presentando una exposición de locomotoras históricas. Desafortunadamente, la empresa que todos los años nos presta las suyas este año ha decidido no hacerlo y no sabemos por qué. Si no conseguimos con qué reemplazarlas, no tendremos nada para exponer.

Ahora... Tu empresa todavía está usando varias de estas viejas locomotoras, ¿Verdad? Nos sería una gran ayuda si pudieras prestarnos una de cada una para el día de la exposición. Nos interesan principalmente las locomotoras de vapor. Por cierto, en una época se fabricó una muy rara versión de la 2-6-0 Porter llamada Red Dwarf. ¿Por alguna de esas casualidades sabrás de alguien que tenga una? ¡Nos encantaría exponerla si pudiésemos hacernos de una!

Hace poco me enteré de lo que hiciste para el Padre Winkelmann. Soy un hombre de fe, y sé que fue la voluntad de Dios reparar el santuario. También me enteré de que no pediste nada a cambio... sabes bien de qué hablo. Las donaciones de los voluntarios para el fondo de reparación apenas fueron una gota en el mar para los números que manejamos nosotros, ¿No es cierto?

Digamos que desde mi posición tengo muchas más posibilidades de expresarte mi gratitud. Quisiera ofrecerte el orgullo de mi empresa, la 872 Sasha. De toda la producción original de 601 unidades, ésta es la última: Nº 601. Es necesario que la aceptes como regalo.

¡Buenas Jefe!

Nos hemos enterado de que hay una gran cantidad de inversores extranjeros pujando en licitaciones estatales para construir nuevas centrales eléctricas. Representantes de empresas energéticas internacionales han comentado que tienen grandes planes para este año.

Hay muchos proyectos de ampliación a las centrales eléctricas para extender las redes actuales, varias de estas nuevas ampliaciones ya están terminadas y en fase de pruebas, y serán integradas a las redes este mismo año. Claro que... las centrales eléctricas consumen grandes cantidades de combustible, ya sea carbón o petróleo, y nosotros tenemos una extensa red ferroviaria y muchos años de experiencia en el transporte de estos materiales.

Buenos días,

Como Gobernador de esta región, le tengo una propuesta comercial para usted y su empresa.

Nuestras urbes están creciendo exponencialmente. Las áreas rurales en la periferia están dejando de usarse para cultivos y se están convirtiendo en residencias, industrias, y avenidas. Esto incrementa la necesidad de recursos básicos como alimentos y necesitamos traerlos desde regiones más lejanas; sin embargo estamos trabajando en una solución. Tenemos ya un contrato con varios grandes productores agrícolas y nos gustaría que su empresa se encargue de la logística de transporte de sus productos a las ciudades.

¡Buenos días!
Tal vez todavía no lo hayas oído, pero Petróleo YouWing acaba de declararse en bancarrota. Tuvieron un rapidísimo crecimiento y una igualmente acelerada caída a pesar de haberse convertido en una de las empresas más influyentes de la comarca. Los vi todos estos años con un acierto comercial tras otro, nunca me hubiese imaginado que terminarían de esta manera.

De cualquier manera, pensé que te interesaría la liquidación de activos. Todas sus propiedades están a la venta y al revisar el inventario encontré varias cosas que nos podrían resultar de interés. Por ejemplo, el lote 420A son 2 locomotoras y varios vagones cisterna. ¡El precio es bastante razonable!

Envié a un grupo de mecánicos a hacer una revisión general de la formación, resulta que la condición de los vagones es bastante peor de la que esperaba. Además tienen el logo de YouWing, algo que probablemente nuestros otros clientes no aprecien. Tal vez no valga la pena ponerlos en condiciones y repintarlos, y sea mejor simplemente revenderlos. De todas maneras, las locomotoras sí nos serán útiles.

C'est une chance inouïe pour votre entreprise! Il n'y a pratiquement pas d'infrastructure existante, vous devriez en profiter.

Ravi de faire votre connaissance. Je suis François Renard, de la coopérative LMBR. Je vous contacte car notre entreprise souhaite développer l'industrie locale.

Tout d'abord, il nous faut amener du bois aux scieries. Comme nous sommes entourés de forêts, il ne devrait pas être difficile d'en trouver. Si vous y arrivez, nous vous payerons généreusement et nous ferons appel à vous à l'avenir!

Si cela vous intéresse, j'ai une autre proposition à vous faire. Nos scieries produisent plus de planches que ce que nos chariots peuvent porter et nos entrepôts commencent à être pleins à craquer! Il faudrait que vous construisiez un chemin de fer entre nos scieries et les ateliers locaux pour accélérer le transport.

Il est grand temps d'investir dans nos gares. Nous n'avons qu'une seule grue, ce qui rend les chargements et déchargements de marchandises trop lents. Les passagers n'ont nulle part où s'asseoir et ils doivent utiliser des toilettes extérieures! Il faut changer cela rapidement.

J’ai réussi à avoir un contrat pour transporter des lingots de fer. L'industrie métallurgique est en plein essor, ce qui nous permet de faire une offre.

Malheureusement, il n’y a pas grand chose à gagner – le marché est beaucoup trop compétitif.

Nous exigeons que vous augmentiez vos livraisons de bois pour couvrir au moins la moitié de la capacité de production de nos scieries.

Bonjour,

Nous serions intéressé pour relier notre ville à celles qui nous entourent en construisant une voie ferrée. Nous pensons que vous n'hésiterez pas à vous joindre à ce projet et à l'impulser. D'ailleurs, nous avons déjà négocié un support financier avec les villes voisines.

Le contrat comprendrait la construction de l'infrastructure et, par la suite, l’exploitation commerciale de la ligne. Nous voulons que nos citoyens bénéficient d'un bon réseau férroviaire tant pour les déplacements de loisir que pour les déplacements professionnels. Montrez à nos citoyens que le gouvernement pense à leur bien-être!

Nos fidèles nous aideront, mais nous aurions besoin de matériaux de construction. Voilà pourquoi nous faisons appel à votre générosité. Nous avons déjà récolté un peu d'argent parmi nos paroissiens.

Mon cher ami, j’ai l’impression que, ces derniers mois, vous avez travaillé énormément et que vous avez besoin d’un peu de repos. 

Votre empire ferroviaire fonctionne à merveille, mais, de temps à autre, vous devriez vous reposer un peu. Sautez sur un de vos trains, mangez un sandwich dans un de vos wagons-restaurants, ou visitez un de vos conducteurs.  Prenez une pause, et admirez la belle campagne depuis une de vos locomotives.

Bonjour,
Comme vous le savez probablement, nous avons débarqué sur le marché des locomotives diesel avec des modèles très avancés. Nous sommes en train de finir la production du modèle 52, qui a été entièrement revu. Ce nouveau modèle est beaucoup plus performant et rapide, mais coûtant la même chose à maintenir que le modèle 52 standard. Avec ces paramètres, cette locomotive est idéale pour transporter des passagers sur des longues routes.

Nos locomotives sont déjà en cours d’exploitation, et nous voudrions vous offrir un modèle 52+ pour faire des essais. Comme précédemment indiqué, l’usage idéal est pour des services de passagers. Si tout fonctionne comme prévu, nous vous donnerons un autre exemplaire de la 52+, gratuitement. 

Êtes-vous intéressé?

Cette fois-ci, j’ai de très bonnes nouvelles. D’après ce que j’ai entendu de sources proches du Ministère de l’Industrie, on vient récemment de découvrir une poche d’or noir – du pétrole !

Peu après, le Ministère a annoncé des subsides pour attirer des investisseurs et commencer l’exploitation de cette nouvelle ressource. Il y a très certainement d’autres gisements, et si nous intervenons tôt, nous pourrions faire un très beau profit.

Avec le développement de l’industrie pétrochimique dans notre région, et l’apparition du diesel comme combustible, nous pourrions investir dans de nouveaux moteurs pour nos trains. Certes, l’investissement initial est colossal, mais nous ne pouvons pas laisser échapper cette opportunité.

Il y a quelque temps, nous avions déjà collaboré sur un contrat, et je voudrais qu’on continue notre coopération. Nous avons besoin de trouver une solution pour le transport de pétrole et produits chimiques de nos raffineries. La plupart des compagnies de transport autour de nous n’ont pas les moyens pour ce genre de travail.

Parfois, nos entrepôts sont tellement remplis que nous devons arrêter la production. Cela nous coûte très, très cher. Je ne vais pas payer des frais d’exploitation inutiles à notre raffinerie. Si elle ne produit rien, il vaut mieux la fermer.

Vous avez sauvé le travail de beaucoup de personnes. Sans vous, cette région serait insoutenable. Cela ne devrait jamais nous arriver ! La plupart des compagnies de transport locales ne font que parler et sont incapables de résoudre quoi que ce soit. 

En tout cas, vous avez démontré que vous êtes quelqu’un à qui l’on peut faire confiance. Ceci n’est, très certainement, pas la dernière fois que vous travaillons ensemble.

Monsieur, un businessman de la compagnie Trans et Cargo m’a contacté avec une offre. Ils ont une vieille locomotive à vapeur en vente. Je sais très bien de quoi il en retourne, il s’agit d’une vieille Porter qui se trouve stockée dans un dépôt depuis des années, depuis une exposition. Je crois qu’ils ne savent pas quoi en faire. C’est une excellente locomotive, mais que ferions-nous d’une épave pareille dans notre compagnie ?

C’est une version modifiée d’une 2-6-0, mais elle ne nous serait pas très utile, surtout en voyant le prix demandé.

Bonjour,

Je suis le propriétaire de l’usine d’acier locale, et cela fait quelques années que nous travaillons avec la mine au Sud-Ouest. Depuis un certain temps, nous stockons des wagons de sable. Mais notre procédé d’acier au silicium a évolué et nous pouvons en produire beaucoup plus en utilisant moins de quartz (sable). La demande pour notre acier continue d’augmenter et nous ne sommes plus capables de le livrer aux usines des alentours, et donc nous avons une offre pour vous. 

D’après les rumeurs, vous êtes un homme d’affaires redoutable, mais il vous manque un peu de %0. Si nous arrivons à un accord, je vous donnerai une certaine quantité de %0 tout de suite, ou bien quelques wagons de sable, et par la suite vous nous aiderez, d’abord en nous procurant des matériaux de base, et puis en livrant l’acier aux usines des alentours. Qu’en dites-vous ?

Bonjour Monsieur,
Cela fait un certain temps depuis notre dernière coopération et les derniers subsides que nous vous avons donné de la part du Ministère de l'Industrie et du Commerce. Aujourd’hui, je voudrais attirer votre attention sur une nouvelle opportunité.

De plus en plus de compagnies et de jeunes gens sont entrain de venir habiter notre région. Le Ministère à décidé d’améliorer le service et de construire une ligne principale pour des trains à haute vitesse entre plusieurs villes importantes. Ceci aiderait les gens à voyager plus confortablement entre leur domicile et leur travail. Vous n’êtes pas sans savoir que les jeunes, de nos jours, veulent voyager confortablement. 

Le Ministère espère que vous contribuerez à un développement rapide de notre région, et nous pensons que votre compagnie pourrait en bénéficier.

Comment ça va, mon gars ?
J’ai vu les nouveaux trains que t’as acheté, et ils on l’air totalement différent des locomotives à vapeur merdiques d’avant. Je me rappelle lorsque t’as commencé avec ton premier train, tellement mauvais, et que t’étais content d’économiser quelques sous sur le combustible.

J’ai lu quelque part que ces nouveaux trains peuvent faire du %1 %2, voire plus. J’ai demandé à un conducteur et il m’a dit que cela pouvait être possible, mais cela nécessite une voie ferrée bien droite et bien longue. Et que sur les voies ferrées actuelles, ils ne peuvent même pas essayer…

Bonjour,
L’année prochaine, nous organisons une exposition de locomotives historiques. Malheureusement, la compagnie qui d’habitude nous les prête a décidé de ne pas nous les prêter cette fois-ci, sans dire pourquoi. Si nous ne trouvons pas un remplacement, il n’y aura rien à montrer. 

Votre compagnie utilise encore ces vieux trains, non ? Vous nous aideriez beaucoup si vous pouviez nous prêter une locomotive de chaque type pour le jour de l’Exposition. Évidemment, nous sommes plutôt intéressés par des locomotives à vapeur. Eventuellement, quelques 460 Porter, qui furent vendu dans une version rare, nommée Red dwarf. Sauriez-vous qui l’a acheté ? Nous sommes très intéressés par ce modèle.

Bonjour patron,

Un grand nombre d’investisseurs étrangers participent à l’appel aux offres du gouvernement pour la construction de centrales électriques. D’après les représentants d’une des compagnies internationales, il y aura beaucoup de projets énergétiques cette année.
Pour l’instant, il est planifié d’agrandir les centrales existantes. De nombreux tests sont déjà en cours, et les nouveaux réseaux devraient être reliés au réseau électrique cette année.

Bien sûr, les centrales électriques consomment de grandes quantités de ressources, que ce soit du charbon ou du pétrole. Nous disposons d’un vaste réseau ferroviaire, et nous avons des années d’expérience dans le transport de charbon et pétrole.

C’est bien de pouvoir achèter de novelles locomotives éléctriques, mais nous ne dispossons pas d’assez de réseau électrifié pour les utiliser. Il faudrait électrifier plusieurs lignes en plus, comme les lignes principales. Ce ne sera pas facile, mais sur le long-terme, cela en vaudra la peine.

Je ne sais pas si vous avez entendu les dernières nouvelles, mais YouWing Oil vient de faire faillite. On est tous surpris, c’est étonnant comment une compagnie qui a grandi aussi vite a pu faire faillite du jour au lendemain. Personne ne s’attendait à qu’ils s’endettent tellement.

Mais passons. Je vous en parle car l’inventaire de la société est en vente pour rembourser les créanciers, et que plusieurs des lots pourraient vous intéresser. Par exemple, le lot 420A, qui est composé de deux locomotives et plusieurs wagons pour le pétrole, est vendu à un prix très attractif.

Bonjour,

Nos ingénieurs sont en train d’assembler un nouveau train pour la compagnie MiningCroft Sud. Généralement, ces trains transportent du charbon sur de longues distances, ce qui est rare dans notre pays.
Coopérer avec cette compagnie pourrait être bénéfique pour nous dans le futur, grâce à des contrats de transport et la possibilité d’ouvrir de nouvelles mines dans notre région.

Cependant, il est important de tester ce genre de longs trains avant leur mise en service.

Pour ce test, assurez-vous d’ajouter quelques wagons et idéalement d’ajouter une autre locomotive au convoi. Surtout si vous comptez le charger entièrement. Souvent, jusqu’à trois locomotives sont utilisées pour accomplir ces missions.

Il faut aussi consulter le conducteur par rapport au trajet à emprunter, car nos gares ne sont pas prévues pour ce genre d’opérations.

Je commence à me demander si, finalement, c’était une bonne idée ou pas.

C’est un plaisir de vous revoir. Un an passe vite, mais j’ai de bonnes nouvelles. Nous avons lancé la production et signé un contrat avec notre premier client. Nous sommes toujours à la recherche de clients achetant de plus gros volumes, comme des supermarchés.

Malheureusement, le projet coûte extrêmement cher, et nous avons rencontré certains imprévus qui on fait augmenter les coûts initiaux. J’irai droit au but : voudriez-vous investir dans notre projet à nouveau ? Je vous offre une plus grande part dans notre société.

Nous produisons de moins en moins de sable dans notre usine, et c’est pour cela que nous devons commencer à considérer l’importation de matériaux d’autres mines.

La production de verre bat son plein, et nous disposons d’assez de sable pour environ une année d’opération. Cela aurait été difficile d’accomplir sans votre aide, et c’est pour cela que vous méritez nos plus sincères remerciements.

Nous avons reçu de nombreuses offres de rachat de la part de concurrents. Notre condition principale était que nous voulions rester indépendants, même après l’achat. Seulement le directeur de Glossy Glasses a été capable de fournir une telle garantie. Ils sont extrêmement intéressés dans la production de verre et sont les seuls à avoir accepté nos conditions.

对于你的公司来说，这是个独一无二的好机会！此地尚无任何运输设施，你应该抓住这个机遇。

我建议刚开始的时候最好先运送旅客。这能让你的公司更便于起步并做到盈利。

你的铁路帝国井井有条，但你也该时不时犒劳一下自己。坐进你的一辆新火车上，在餐车里尝尝精致的三明治；或者和精干的司机一起驾驶。在高速掠过田野的火车上好好放松一下吧。

您好！您可能已经听说过了，近十年来我们一直在向市场推广堪称艺术品的燃气车头。我们现在正在进行52型机车升级型号的收尾工作，现在已经能够投入测试了。在保养成本不变的基础上，我们成功地提高了本款机车的性能以及最大速度。有了这些新新能的支持，本产品将会非常适合在更长的线路上输送旅客。

由于我们的车头已经可以实装了，所以我们愿意提供一辆52+型号的原型车用来测试。和之前说的一样，本产品是为了客运而优化的，测试也要与之相关。如果一切顺利，我们将免费赠送您一台额外的52+型原型车头供您使用。

您意下如何？

阿哈，这次我带来了了不得的好消息！我从工业部长的熟人那里听说，前阵子发掘出了一小座黑色的金矿——油田！

没过多久，赞助的机器设备就开钻了；工业部也开始招商引资，寻找合作方进行开采。肯定还有别的油田，如果我们也及时参与进去的话，我们肯定能从这里大赚一笔。

随着我们地区的石油化工工业不断发展，也随着石油作为燃料的普及，我们就更有理由对燃气动力引擎投资了。这需要一些先期投入，但我们可不能在此事上落后于人。

不长时间之前，我们曾经在石油进口订单上进行过合作，我现在希望能够延续这种合作关系。我们需要找到把石油制品及化工原料从精炼厂运送出去的手段，这附近的其他运输公司根本就满足不了我们的需求。

我们的库房有的时候爆满到了不得不让生产停摆的程度，您可能想象不到这会带来多大损失。比起花冤枉钱养着一个无法生产的精炼厂，甚至都不如直接把它关停来的划算。

数年以来，我们的科学家都在竭尽所能去寻找一种办法，以便降低我们这门生意运转时造成的污染；同时这也是为了让现代铁路运输能更符合生态学利益。在许多关于直流电池和独立牵引的失败方案之后，第一个架空线路牵引的原型终于付出了水面；很快用电作为能源的火车头就将要投入运转了。

这里面的收益是非常多的。有生态方面的好处，当然更主要还是经济上的。但我们必须先完成这个原型机，然后再铺设首条电气化轨道。此事的投入肯定不会小，但我们能够从中得到巨大的技术领先。

先生，铁路集装公司的一位商务人员和我联系了一笔生意。他们想出售一台老式蒸汽机车。巧的是，我很清楚他们指的是哪一台。那是一台老式的波特型，自从上次展出之后已经存在一个旧车库里许多年了。我猜他们也想不出能用它干什么。它倒是一台漂亮的老爷车，可是我们买了这堆破烂能有什么实际用处呢？

那是一台改造过的2-6-0型，但我想不出用这么高的价格买下它对我们有什么好处。

您好：

我是本地炼钢厂的厂主。我们已经和西南矿场合作了几年了，也用了很多沙土车皮来运货。但是，我们的硅钢处理技术已经经过了改进，现在用更少的石英（砂）来炼制更多的钢材。周围工厂对我们的的进货需求也大大增长，现在已经超出了我们亲自运送货物的能力，所以我想找您合作。

据传言说，您是一位颇有能力的经营者，只不过手头欠缺一点%0。如果我们能够达成合作，我现在就可以给您提供一定数量的%0，或者把我们多余的砂土车厢送给您使用。而您则要帮我们运送原料到炼钢厂，然后把钢材运到当地工厂去。您意下如何？

朋友您好！
明年我们将会将举办一次关于历史上火车头的传统展览。不幸的是，曾经答应我们要出借机车的公司突然之间改口拒绝了。如果我们找不到其他展品，那就跟本没东西可展了。

您的公司仍然有旧型号在服役对吧？如果您能从每个型号里抽调一台车头供我们在展览上展出，那就帮大忙了。当然，我们主要感兴趣的还是蒸汽机车。我记得，有一台特别罕见的波特4-6-0型车头，人称“红矮星”的机车之前被买走了。您知道是谁出手买下来的吗？我们对这台机车十分感兴趣。

一大批国外投资者纷纷前来参加政府招标的发电厂承建项目。据一位外来的投标代表所说，能源项目是今年的重头戏。
今年计划扩建现有的发电厂厂区。许多新的厂区已经在测试中了。年内这些电力产出就能实现并网。

当然，发电厂是不可避免要消耗大量燃料的，不论燃煤的还是燃油的都是如此。我们坐拥庞大的铁路网，而且我们在运煤运油的业务上早已驾轻就熟了。

我不知道您是否已经听说了——君翼石油集团宣布破产了。作为国内最有影响力的企业之一，他们起家的时候发展速度可谓惊人，但是跌落神坛的时候也一样是眨眼之间。我也是眼看着他们的事业飞黄腾达的，谁能想到几年之后就沦落到欠一屁股债？

但我提起这个主要是因为它要面临清偿了。他们的资产马上要被拍卖了，而我在他们的资产清单里找到不少对我们有用的东西。比如第420A号物品是一列火车，带双联车头外加不少节油罐车。而且它的标价相当划算！

您好。

我们的工程师正在为南方矿业集团建造一列新的火车。通常这些火车是用来进行超长途煤矿运输的，由于我们的国土面积不大，在我们国内很难想象这样长距离的铁路运输。
与这家矿业公司进行合作对我们未来的运输业务来说是很大利好，而且没准还能在我们地区也多开挖几块新的矿区。

然而，在我们交货之前，需要先测试保证这么长的火车能够运转良好才行。

测试时别忘了连上足够多的车厢，而且最好能多加一台车头牵引。尤其是如果您打算满负荷测试，就更有必要了。为了达到合适的指标，最多用三台车头牵引都是很常见的。

提前和司机商量规划好路线也是很重要的，您别忘了我们的火车站都不是按照这种规格修建的。

我现在有点担心这是不是个好主意，不过毕竟已经到这步了。

先生您好。

很高兴见到您，也很感谢您愿意安排会面。
我希望能和您谈论一次小投资的事宜。我们计划让一座老玻璃厂恢复生产，并且借此复兴我们地区悠久的玻璃制造传统。我们已经买下了一座老玻璃厂，而且也找到了一些合适的人员，包括一些拥有多年经验的老玻璃匠，他们都是业界翘楚。

不幸的是，我们目前还没有正式投产的启动资金。根据预算，%0就足够让我们修缮老玻璃厂方并且支付玻璃匠们头几个月的工资了。

您好，我的朋友！

玻璃生产现在已经全力开动了，沙土的存量也十分充足，恐怕用到明年都没有问题。如果没有您的帮助，这恐怕是不可能实现的。事实上我到现在还感觉仿佛是在梦里一样，谢您一辈子都不足以表达我的感激。

有好几个公司都向我们表达了购买我们玻璃厂的意愿。我们要求把保持独立作为一项基本条件，哪怕并购之后也必须要满足这一点。只有亮璃公司的执行代表同意了我们的这个要求。他们对于玻璃厂有着迫切的需求，而且他们也是唯一同意我们这边条件的投资方。

何もかもがうまくいってます！私達の親方たちも満足していますよ、これは珍しいことなんです。これがずっと続いてくれればいいんですけど。

興味がお有りなら、まだ仕事はあります。私達の製材所は馬車で扱える量よりも多くの材木を生産しており、おかげで倉庫はほぼ一杯になってしまっています！輸送の高速化の為に製材所と地域の工具工場を線路で繋げてもらう必要があります。

こんにちは

助けが必要なためあなたとあなたの会社に連絡させていただきました。私は最近の嵐でひどく被害を受けた森林を所有しています。私たちは木々の多くを切り倒し、この木材をすぐ売るためいくつかの製材所と交渉しました。私たちは人手は足りてます、がしかしとても多くの木材を移動させる方法がわかりません。助けていただければ売り上げを割り当てさせていただこうと考えております。

よろしくお願いします。

最近発見された鉄鉱石の堆積物には非常に興奮させられます。鋳物工場は政府の支援を受け鉄鉱石を加工していますが、工場自体が輸送することできません...

これは当社がこの市場に参入する最適な機会です。私は首尾よく地方当局からの資金援助の交渉をしましたが、契約の一環として、当局は我々に石炭も輸送してもらうことを望んでいます。

はい! 鉄のインゴットを輸送する契約を結びました。冶金が増えてきているので契約の交渉の可能性があります。

じれったいことに、余計なお金がありません - 市場は競争が激しいのです。

困ったことになりました。あなたの会社も問題を抱えているようですね。わが社は木材加工業に、結構な額を投資しています。そちらは我が製材所で扱える量の半分も運搬していていらっしゃらないご様子。

少なくとも我々の製材所でさばける材木量の半分くらいは運搬量を増やしていただけませんか。

To niepowtarzalna szansa dla Twojej firmy! Tak naprawdę nie istnieje tu żadna infrastruktura transportowa. Powinieneś z tego skorzystać.

Wydaje się, że najlepszą rzeczą byłoby rozpoczęcie od przewozu pasażerów. To dość łatwy i tani sposób na zarobienie trochę pieniędzy i ruszenie pełną parą.

Niech no się przedstawię. Jestem Jacek Drewniak, zastępca kierownika firmy Deski i Deseczki. Nasza firma planuje inwestycje w lokalny przemysł. To dlatego się z Tobą skontaktowałem.

Najpierw musimy dowieźć drewniane bale do naszych tartaków. Lasy są wszędzie w okolicy, więc nie powinno być problemu ze znalezieniem jakiegoś. Jeśli Ci się powiedzie, zapłacimy sowicie, a w przyszłości możemy mieć więcej zleceń!

Jeżeli jesteś zainteresowany, mam dla Ciebie kolejną propozycję. Nasze tartaki produkują więcej tarcicy niż wozy konne są w stanie przewieźć, a nasze magazyny są już prawie pełne! Potrzebujemy abyś połączył koleją nasze tartaki z lokalnymi fabrykami narzędzi aby przyspieszyć transport.

Witaj.

Kontaktuję się z Twoim przedsiębiorstwem, ponieważ szukam pomocy. Mam las, który mocno ucierpiał po ostatniej zawiei. Sporo drzew się połamało. Dogadałem się z kilkoma tartakami, że odkupią ode mnie to drewno. Mam sporo ludzi do pracy, ale nie mam transportu. Pomóż, a podzielimy się zyskami.

Z poważaniem,

Marcin Heban

Te ostatnio odkryte złoża rudy żelaza to świetna wiadomość. Huty mają rządowe wsparcie na przetwórstwo rudy żelaza, ale ona sama się nie przewiezie...

To jest najlepszy moment, by wejść na rynek. Wynegocjowałem wsparcie finansowe od lokalnych władz, ale chcą byśmy w ramach umowy transportowali również węgiel.

     Uruchomiona została wczesna wersja Alpha Mashinky. Gra jest cały czas rozwijana.
     Pracowałem przy tym projekcie sam przez 7 ostatnich lat. Teraz, razem ze społecznością
     i utalentowanymi osobami wokół mnie planujemy wytworzenie najlepszej gry
     typu 'tycoon' jaka kiedykolwiek powstała.
           Jan Zeleny

     \c\c\i22AA397D \cF0EAC2\bPracujemy nad tym:\b
     - Tryb dla wielu graczy
     - Tryb maszynisty (obecnie możesz przejechać się pociągiem sterowanym przez SI)
     - Uzupełnienie braków w postaci: ikonki, pojedyncze pola tekstowe
     - (wciąż możesz trafić na tymczasowe grafiki lub tekst - będzie tego coraz mniej)

 \c\c\i8EB66346 \cF0EAC2\bFinalna wersja zawierać będzie: \b
     - 7 epok - od Ery Pary do Przyszłości
     - 16 typów towarów i 21 rodzajów przemysłu
     - Ponad 25 typów lokomotyw i 40 rodzajów wagonów 
     - Więcej historii, zadań, wyzwań i wydarzeń
     - Tryb maszynisty - pociągi kontrolowane przez gracza
     - Gra wieloosobowa do 8 graczy
     - Wsparcie dla modów (Steam Workshop - nowe lokomotywy/wagony, przemysł, etc)
     - I wiele więcej.... w tym plany odnośnie innych typów transportu !

Mój drogi, mam wrażenie, że spędziłeś ostatnie miesiące ciężko harując i zasłużyłeś na przerwę.

Twoje imperium transportowe świetnie sobie radzi, więc możesz trochę odsapnąć. Wskocz w jeden ze swoich pociągów, skosztuj pysznej kanapki z bufetu, albo po prostu przejedź się z jednym ze swoich wyszkolonych maszynistów. Zrób sobie przerwę i rozkoszuj się pięknymi widokami z perspektywy pędzącego pociągu.

Dzień dobry,
Jak prawdopodobnie wiesz, weszliśmy na rynek prezentując w tej dekadzie zaawansowane lokomotywy z silnikami diesla. Właśnie jesteśmy w końcowej fazie opracowywania prototypu ulepszonej wersji naszej \"52\" - właśnie rozpoczeliśmy testy. Utrzymując koszty operacyjne na tym samym poziomie udało nam się osiągnąć znaczną poprawę rezultatów, zarówno jeśli chodzi o wydajności jak i maksymalną prędkość. Wydaje się nam, że nowa lokomotywa będzie idealna do przewozu pasażerów na dalsze odległości. 

Nasze lokomotywy są już w użyciu, chcielibyśmy zaproponować Ci prototyp \"52+\" do przetestowania. Jak mówiłem wcześniej - najlepiej sprawdzi się w transporcie pasażerów. Jeśli wszystko się uda - dostaniesz od nas drugi egzemplarz testowy \"52+\" całkowicie za darmo.

Wchodzisz w to ?

Jakiś czas temu babraliśmy się wspólnie w ropie i chciałbym wrócić do tematu. Musimy znaleźć rozwiązanie dla transportu produktów ropopochodnych / chemikaliów z naszych rafinerii. Większość firm spedycyjnych jest całkowicie nieogarnięta.

Nasze magazyny są czasami tak pełne, że musimy przerwać produkcję, a to generuje takie straty, że sobie nawet nie wyobrażasz. Nie zamierzam płacić niepotrzebnych kosztów rafinerii, która nie produkuje, Lepiej zamknąć taki biznes.

Sembra che i nostri ingegneri siano vicini ad alcuni grandi passi nello sviluppo dei motori a vapore, a seguito delle recenti scoperte nella metallurgia e al piano di apertura della prima fonderia nella nostra regione.

Questa è un unica opportunità per la tua compagnia! Praticamente non ci sono infrastrutture qui. Dovresti approfittarne.

Penso che la cosa migliore sarebbe iniziare con il trasporto passeggeri. È un modo economico per fare soldi e avviare la tua azienda.

Lascia che mi presenti. Sono Jack Tamiel, LMBR Deputy Co. La nostra azienda prevede di investire nello sviluppo dell'industria locale. Ecco perché ti ho contattato.

Per prima cosa, dobbiamo consegnare i tronchi alle nostre segherie. Le foreste sono ovunque intorno a noi, quindi non dovrebbero esserci problemi a trovarle. Se ci riesci, ti pagheremo bene e potremmo avere più lavoro per te!

Hai salvato il lavoro di molte persone perché altrimenti questo stato sarebbe insostenibile, questo non dovrebbe mai accadere a noi! La maggior parte dei trasportatori locali sono solo chiacchiere e non sono in grado di risolvere nulla. In ogni caso, hai dimostrato di essere una persona capace, siamo certi di non commerciare insieme per l'ultima volta.

\i8EB66346 \c484539Finálna hra bude obsahovať:\c
\iDEAFDEAF
 - 7 historických období, od parných strojov až po moderný Maglev,
 - 16 rôzných typov surovín, 28 lokomotív a viac ako 40 rôznych vagónov,
 - ďalšie úlohy, výzvy a herné udalosti,
 - multiplayer až pre 8 hráčov,
 - podporu modov cez Steam Workshop,
 - možnosť riadiť mašinku :)
 - a ešte omnoho viac... Vrátane ďalších typov dopravy!

\iDEAFDEAF
Majte prosím na pamäti, že se jedná o alfa verziu hry, ktorá je stále vo vývoji. Pracoval som na hre 7 rokov sám a teraz, spoločne s komunitou a talentovanými ľuďmi okolo mňa, chcem vydať najlepší tycoon ako len bude možné.

Toto je jedinečná príležitosť pre tvoju spoločnosť! Neexistuje tu v podstate žiadna dopravná infraštruktúra. Mal by si to využiť.

Myslím, že najlepšie bude začať prepravou osôb. Je to lacný spôsob, ako zarobiť peniaze a naštartovať firmu.

Dovoľte mi aby som sa predstavil. Volám sa Jack Tamiel, som zástupca
holdingu LMBR Co. Naša spoločnosť má v pláne investovať do rozvoja tunajšieho priemyslu. Práve preto sa obraciame na Vás a Vašu spoločnosť.

Prvotná časť plánu je rozbehnúť dodávku guľatiny do našich píl. Lesov je tu
celkom dosť, takže s guľatinou by nemal byť problém. Pokiaľ sa Vám
to podarí, dostanete slušnú odmenu a môžeme nadviazať ďalšiu
spoluprácu.

Spolupráca pokračuje veľmi dobre. Moji nadriadení sú spokojní a to sa zas tak často nestáva. Dúfam, že im to vydrží.

Ak máš záujem, mám pre teba ďalšiu ponuku. Píly produkujú viac dreva, ako naše konské záprahy zvládnu previesť a pílam sa už zapĺňajú sklady. Preto potrebujeme spojiť píly s továrňami na náradie železnicou a zrýchliť prepravu.

Šéfko,
mal by si investovať do modernizácie budov. S tým jedným žeriavom na stanici je nakladanie a vykladanie tovaru extrémne pomalé. V čakárniach sa tlačia ľudia a na záchod chodia do bistra oproti. Niečo by sa s tým malo urobiť.

Dobrý deň,
Obraciam sa na Vás a Vašu firmu s žiadosťou o pomoc. Vlastníme les,
ktorý dosť poničil silný vietor pri nedávnej búrke a väčšinu stromov
polámal. Dohodli sme sa s okolitými pílami na spracovaní dreva.
Ľudí máme dosť ale nemáme ako drevo v takom objeme 
prepraviť do píl. O zisk sa podelíme.

S prianím pekného dňa

Nedávno objavené ložiská železnej rudy sú veľmi zaujímavé. Zlievarne majú priestor na spracovanie väčšieho množstva železnej rudy, ale nemôžu ju prepraviť...

Toto je perfektný moment preto, aby sa naša firma dostala do tohto trhu. Už som úspešne dohodol finančnú podporu od miestnych autorít, ale chcú aby sme prevážali aj uhlie.

Môžeš to vyriešiť napríklad takto:
- postaviť otočku tak aby sa vozidlo jazdou vpred otočilo,
- pripojiť na koniec trate depo, kam vozidlo zájde a vyjde prednou časťou,
- umiestniť T odbočku, do ktorej vďaka používaniu prejazdových bodov v jazdnom poriadku
necháš vozidlo zacúvať a potom rozbehnúť vpred,

Kamarát, mám taký pocit, že si poslednou dobou kvôli tvrdej práci nemáš čas ani odpočinúť.

Železničné impérium Ti prekvitá, ale mal by si si dať občas zaslúžený oddych. Skoč do jedného z tvojich moderných vlakov, daj si preslávený sendvič v jedálenskom vagóne, alebo sa zvez spolu s jedným z Tvojich šikovných strojvedúcich. Jednoducho si daj na chvíľu pauzu a kochaj sa krásnou krajinou z uháňajúceho vlaku.

Dobrý deň,
ako iste viete, tútu dekádu sne uviedli na trh najmodernejšie naftové lokomotívy. Práve sme tesne pred dokončením vylepšenej verzie nášho typu 52, ktorý začíname testovať v prevádzke. Pri zachovaní rovnakých prevádzkových nákladov sa nám podarilo dosiahnuť vyšší výkon a vyššiu maximálnu rýchlosť. S týmito parametrami je idálna k preprave cestujúcich na dlhsích trasách.

Keďže už naše lokomotívy používate, chceme Vám ponúknuť na testovaciu prevádzku náš prototyp 52+. Ako som už hovoril, je ideálne ho používať na prepravu pasažierov. Ak sa všetko podarí, venujeme Vám ďalšiu testovaciu lokomotívu 52+.

Tak ako, dohodneme sa?

Naše sklady sú niekedy také plné, že musíme pozastaviť výrobu a to stojí peniaze, aké si ani neviete predstaviť! Nebudem platiť zbytočné náklady na rafinérie, ktoré stoja a nevyrábajú, to ich radšej nechám nadobro zatvoriť!

Dobrý deň,

Moja oceliareň už pár rokov spolupracuje s baňou na juhozápade a dostatočne sme sa predzásobili vagónmy na piesok. Náš proces zušľachtovania kremičitej ocele ale pokročil a teraz sme schopní vyrobiť o mnoho viac ocele za použitia menej kremeňa (piesku). Záujem o našu oceľ rastie a my prestávame stíhať jej dodávku do okolitých tovární a tak by som mal pre Vás ponuku.

O Vás sa hovorí, že ste schopný obchodník, len Vám chýba %0. Ak sa dohodneme, dám Vám %0 hneď teraz, alebo Vám prenecháme zopár prebytočných vagónov na piesok a vy mi potom pomôžete s dodávkou suroviny pre moju oceliareň a potom s dodávkou ocele pre miestne továrne.
Čo na to hovoríte?

Ahoj kamarát,
Budúci rok usporiadavame tradičnú výstavu historických lokomotív. Bohužiaľ, spoločnosť, ktorá nám ich požičiavala, nám ich tento rok bezdôvodne odmietla požičiať. Ak nezískame náhradu, nebudeme mať čo vystavovať.

Vaša spoločnosť stále používa staré lokomotívy, nie? Bolo by nám veľmi nápomocné ak by ste nám poskytli jednu lokomotívu z každého druhu počas výstavy.
Your company is still running these old trains, right? It would be very helpful if you could provide us with one locomitove of each type for the Exhibition day. Of course, we are mostly interested in steam engines. Eventually, some 460 Porters were sold in a very rare version called Red dwarf. Do you know by chance who bought it? We would be very interested in this one.

Подейкують,  що наші інженери наблизилися до значного вдосконалення двигунів, пов'яназаного із останніми відкриттями у металургії та запланованим запуском першої ливарні у нашому регіоні.

В результаті вони скоро зможуть будувати навіть швидші та більші парові локомотиви. Їм лише потрібні ресурси для завершення багаторічної розробки.

Це унікальна можливість для вашої компанії! Тут практично відсутня транспортна інфраструктура. Вам варто цим скористатися.

Я думаю, що найкраще буде розпочати з пасажирських перевезень. Це дешевий спосіб заробити трохи коштів та запустити свою компанію.

Для початку, нам потрібно доставити ліс на наші лісопильні. Ліси скрізь навколо нас, тож їхніми пошуками не має виникнути проблем. Якщо ви успішно справитеся, ми добре заплатимо, і, можливо, у нас знайдеться ще робота для вас.

Вітаю,

Ми хотіли б погодити з вами угоду щодо будівництва залізниці до нашого міста. Ми провели перемовини щодо фінансової підтримки від навколишніх міст, але ви маєте розпочати з когось більш політично важливого. Тобто з нас.

Контракт включатиме в себе будівництво платформ, колій і, в решті решт, надання сервісу з перевезення. Ми хочемо забезпечити людей транспортом для подорожей на роботу та культурного обміну. Переконайтеся в тому, що ваші потяги будуть наочно демонструвати, що влада дбає про людей!

Вітаю, сину мій,

Наша скромна парафія не має місця для молитви та притулку. Завдяки громаді, ми змогли придбати дуже стару та занедбану церкву, яку ми б хотіли відремонтувати. Наші послідовники допоможуть, але нам необхідні будівельні матеріали. Ось чому я хотів би попросити вас про допомогу. Ми зібрали пожертвування з наших парафіян. Тут небагато, але може цього буде достатньо.

Гра Машинки присвячена залізниці. Найпростіша залізнична лінія має сполучати між собою дві станції та депо.

Залізна дорога: \i02D833B5 Станція: \i18EEB9CD Депо: \iEAEB89AA

Давайте розпочнемо із будівництва залізничної лінії та перевезення пасажирів між містами:

    <string name="4D8BB050">\bПерша лінія\b

Для початку, давайте побудуємо станцію. Станції необхідні для завантаження, розвантаження та зберігання вантажів. Підприємства використовують ці вантажі для виготовлення нових продуктів, які вони потім теж розміщують на станціях з метою подальшого перевезення. Матеріали, які можуть приймати станції, залежать від підприємств, розташованих довкола станцій.

Naši inžinjeri kažu da su na pragu velikog poboljšanja parnih motora, što je povezano s najnovijim otkrićima u metalurgiji i planiranim otvaranjem prve lijevaonice u našoj regiji.

Kao rezultat toga, inžinjeri će uskoro moći graditi još brže i veće parne lokomotive. Sada im samo trebaju resursi za puno godina razvoja.

- 7 era od Parnog doba do Budućnosti
- 16 različitih tipova tereta i 21 industrija
- Preko 25 lokomotiva i 40 različitih vagona
- Još priča, zadataka, izazova i događaja
- Vlakovi pod kontrolom igrača
- Multiplayer za do 8 igrača
- Podrška za modove uz Steam Workshop (za proizvoljne vlakove, nove industrije, itd)
- I puno više... Uključujući i planove za druge vrste transporta!

\iDEAFDEAF
Molim imaj na umu da je ovo Alpha build i igra je još u intenzivnoj izradi. Radio sam na ovoj igri 7 godina sam, i sad, uz pomoć zajednice i nadarenih ljudi oko mene, cilj nam je napraviti najbolju tycoon igru ikad. 

Hvala ti na tvojoj podršci!

Als eerste moeten we boomstammen aan onze houtzagerijen leveren. Bossen zijn overal, dus het is geen probleem om boomstammen te vinden. Als je daarin slaagt betalen we je daarvoor en hebben we misschien wel meer werk voor je!

Hallo,

Ik neem contact met u en uw bedrijf op omdat ik hulp nodig heb. Ik bezit het bos dat zwaar werd getroffen door de recente storm. Veel bomen zijn omgevallen. Ik heb met een enkele houtzagerijen een afspraak gemaakt om aan hen de boomstammen te verkopen. Ondanks dat ik veel personeel heb, weet ik niet hoe ik deze hoeveelheid boomstammen moet verplaatsen. Als u mij helpt delen we de winst.

De recente ontdekking van ijzerafzettingen is enorm opwindend. IJzergieterijen ontvangen overheidssubsidies om meer ijzer te verwerken, alleen vervoert het zichzelf niet...

Dit is het ideale moment voor ons bedrijf om ons op deze markt te begeven. Ik heb met succes financiële ondersteuning van de lokale overheid geregeld. Als deel van de overeenkomst verwachten ze echter dat we ook kolen vervoeren.

Ik zit met een groot probleem. Eigenlijk is het een probleem voor ons beide. Ons bedrijf heeft aanzienlijk geïnvesteerd in houtzaagtechniek. Jouw bedrijf levert slechts de helft van wat onze houtzagerijen kunnen verwerken.

Wij eisen een verhoging van de afgeleverde hoeveelheid boomstammen met minstens de helft van de capaciteit van onze houtzagerijen.

Hallo,

We willen een voorstel bespreken om een spoorverbinding naar onze stad aan te leggen. We hebben met omliggende steden een financiële bijdrage onderhandeld maar we willen dat je begint met een politiek meer belangrijk punt: ons.

Het voorstel omvat de bouw van perrons, sporen en, naderhand, het onderhouden van een dienstregeling. We willen de bevolking vervoer aanbieden voor werk en cultuur. Maak dat je treinen tonen dat de overheid om hen geeft!

Mijn vriend, ik heb zo'n onmiskenbaar gevoel dat je de afgelopen paar maanden te hard hebt gewerkt en dat je er tussenuit moet gaan.

Je spoorwegimperium doet het goed, weet je, maar je moet wel eens een pauze inlassen. Spring in een van je moderne treinen, proef een befaamde sandwich in een van je restauratierijtuigen of maak een rit met een van je ervaren machinisten. Ga er even tussenuit en geniet van het prachtige landschap vanuit de rijdende trein.

Met behoud van dezelfde bedrijfskosten hebben we hogere prestaties en een hogere maximumsnelheid bereikt. Met deze gegevens is het ideaal voor het vervoer van passagiers op langere routes.

Omdat onze locomotieven al in gebruik zijn willen we ons prototype 52+ aanbieden voor testen. Zoals ik al zei, is het het beste om te worden gebruikt voor het vervoer van passagiers. Als alles slaagt geven we je nog twee gratis testlocomotieven 52+ voor je diensten.

Dus, doe je mee?

Wauw, dit keer heb ik echt geweldig nieuws. Vanuit de kringen rondom de minister van Industrie hoorde ik dat er enige tijd geleden een klein veld met zwart goud gevonden is - olie!

Niet lang daarna ging de subsidiekraan open en het ministerie trekt nu al investeerders aan om te gaan ontginnen. Er zullen zeker meer velden zijn en als we niet aan de zijlijn blijven staan dan zouden we hier een degelijke winst uit kunnen halen.

Met de ontwikkeling van de petrochemische industrie in onze regio en als brandstofbron, hebben we meer redenen om te investeren in dieselmotoren voor onze treinen. Het zal een initiële investering vereisen, maar we kunnen hier niet verliezen.

Enige tijd geleden hadden we het over het olie-importcontract en ik zou er graag een vervolg aan geven. We moeten een oplossing vinden voor het transport van aardolieproducten / chemicaliën uit onze raffinaderijen. De meeste vervoerders in de buurt zijn onbekwaam.

Onze magazijnen zijn soms zo vol dat we de productie moeten stoppen en dat kost bakken met geld. Ik ga geen onnodige kosten voor de raffinaderij betalen als hij niet produceert. Het is beter om hem in plaats daarvan te sluiten.

Na vele niet-succesvolle proeven met galvanische cellen en onafhankelijke tractie is het eerste prototype afhankelijk van bovenleiding opgesteld en zal binnenkort de eerste elektrisch aangedreven locomotief werkend zijn.

Er zijn veel voordelen, of het nou ecologisch of vooral economisch is. Maar we zullen het prototype moeten voltooien en dan de eerste geëlektrificeerde baan moeten aanleggen. De investering zal niet klein zijn, maar we zullen een enorme technische voorsprong krijgen.

Meneer, een zakenman van Trans en Cargo nam contact met me op met een aanbod. Ze hebben een oude stoomlocomotief te koop. Toevallig weet ik heel goed waar het over gaat. De oude Porter is al vele jaren opgeslagen in een oud depot, sinds een tentoonstelling. Ik denk dat ze niet weten wat ze ermee moeten doen. Het is een mooie veteraan, maar wat zouden we doen met dat oude wrak in ons bedrijf?

Het is een aangepaste 2-6-0 versie, maar het lijkt niet interessant voor ons, vooral niet voor zo'n hoeveelheid geld.

Hallo,

Als eigenaar van lokale staalfabrieken werken we al een paar jaar samen met de zuidwestmijn en we zijn al een tijdje zandwagons aan het inslaan. Ons proces van siliciumstaal is echter verder ontwikkeld en we kunnen nu veel meer staal produceren met minder kwarts (zand). De vraag naar ons staal groeit en we kunnen het niet meer voldoende aan de omliggende fabrieken leveren, dus ik heb een aanbod voor je.

Er wordt gezegd dat je een capabele zakenman bent, maar je mist wat van %0. Als we een deal sluiten, geef ik je nu een bepaald percentage %0, of geef je een paar overtollige zandwagons, en dan help je me eerst door de grondstof voor mijn staalfabrieken te leveren en vervolgens door staal aan lokale fabrieken te leveren. Wat zeg je er van?

Goedendag meneer,

Het is lang geleden sinds onze laatste samenwerking om subsidies te krijgen van het ministerie van Industrie en Handel. Vandaag zou ik nogmaals uw aandacht willen vestigen op de nieuwe mogelijkheid.

Steeds meer bedrijven en jongeren verhuizen naar onze regio. Het ministerie heeft besloten de bruikbaarheid te verbeteren en een centrale lijn te bouwen voor snel verkeer tussen verschillende belangrijke steden. Mensen moeten gemakkelijker reizen tussen werk en thuis. U weet hoe jonge mensen tegenwoordig veeleisend zijn en comfort willen.

Het ministerie hoopt op een nog meer drastische ontwikkeling van onze regio, en uw bedrijf zal er ook van profiteren.

Ik heb de nieuwe treinen gezien die je hebt gekocht en dat is een totaal andere klasse dan de oude, waardeloze stoomwagens. Ik kan me herinneren hoe je begon met de eerste trein, zo'n armzalig ding, en je was blij dat je wat overhield voor brandstof.

Hallo vriend,
Volgend jaar houden we een traditionele tentoonstelling van historische locomotieven. Helaas heeft het bedrijf dat ze aan ons uitleent dit jaar afgezegd zonder rede. Als we geen vervanging krijgen, is er niks om tentoon te stellen.

Jouw bedrijf heeft deze oude treinen nog steeds in gebruik, toch? We zullen je zeer dankbaar zijn als je ons een locomotief van elk type kan verschaffen voor de tentoonstellingsdag. We zijn natuurlijk voor het grootste deel geïnteresseerd in stoomlocomotieven. Kort geleden zijn een paar 460 Porters verkocht in een zeer zeldzame versie genaamd Red dwarf. Heb jij enig idee wie ze heeft gekocht? We zouden er graag een op de tentoonstelling willen hebben.

Goedemorgen baas,

Een groot aantal buitenlandse investeerders heeft zich ingeschreven op de aanbesteding van de overheid voor de bouw van energiecentrales. Volgens een vertegenwoordiger van één van de internationale bedrijven zijn elektrische energieprojecten dit jaar enorm. 
Het is de bedoeling om de huidige centrales uit te breiden. Sommige nieuwe blokken worden al getest. De eerste elektriciteit moet dit jaar op het netwerk worden aangesloten.

Natuurlijk verbruiken energiecentrales een enorme hoeveelheid brandstof, of het nu gaat om kolen of olie. We hebben een groot spoorwegnet en we hebben vele jaren ervaring in het vervoer van kolen en olie.

Hallo,

Als gouverneur van onze regio, heb ik een zakelijk aanbod voor u en uw bedrijf.

Onze steden groeien sneller en sneller. De omliggende akkers, waar recent landbouwgewassen zijn geteeld, veranderen geleidelijk in woonwijken, industriële zones en wegen. Tegelijkertijd neemt de vraag naar voedsel toe en moeten we van verder weg importeren.
We werken aan een oplossing. We hebben al een voorbestellingscontract met verschillende grote boeren en we willen dat u de logistiek tussen hen en onze steden afhandelt.

Baas,

Het is leuk om de mogelijkheid te hebben om nieuwe elektrische locomotieven te kopen, maar we hebben niet genoeg geëlektrificeerde rails om ze te gebruiken. We moeten een redelijk deel van ons spoorwegnetwerk elektrificeren, althans op de hoofdlijnen. Het zal niet gemakkelijk zijn, maar het zal uiteindelijk zeker de moeite waard zijn.

Goedemorgen baas,

Ik weet niet of je het al hebt gehoord, maar het bedrijf YouWing Oil heeft faillissement aangevraagd. Een razendsnelle stijging en even snelle daling van één van de meest invloedrijke bedrijven in de provincie. Ik zag naar hun talrijke bedrijfssuccessen, maar bijna niemand verwachtte dat dit enkele jaren later in schulden zou eindigen.

Maar waarom ik het noem, is vanwege de liquidatie van het bedrijf zelf. Hun eigendom zal te koop zijn en toen ik de inventaris controleerde, waren er verschillende interessante items voor ons. Bijvoorbeeld item 420A, een treinstel van 2 locomotieven en verschillende oliewagons. En de prijs is heel aardig.

Misschien is het niet de moeite waard ze te restaureren en te verven en het is beter om die wagons te verkopen. Maar de locomotieven zullen van pas komen.

Hallo,

Onze ingenieurs bouwen een nieuwe trein voor de MiningCroft Company. Meestal vervoeren deze treinen steenkool over lange afstanden, bijna ondenkbaar in ons land.
Samenwerking met dit mijnbedrijf kan ons in de toekomst meer stimulans voor transport geven, en mogelijk de opening van nieuwe mijnsites in onze regio.

Het is echter noodzakelijk om de werking van een dergelijke lange trein te testen, voordat deze wordt afgeleverd.

Zorg ervoor dat je een aantal wagons en liefst nog een andere locomotief aankoppelt voor deze test. Vooral als je maximale belasting van plan bent. Idealiter worden vaak tot drie locomotieven gebruikt.

Het is ook noodzakelijk om de route met de machinist te bespreken, onthoud dat onze stations hier niet voor zijn gebouwd.

Ik maak me een beetje zorgen dat het helemaal geen goed idee was.

Leuk u te ontmoeten en heel erg bedankt voor uw toestemming voor een vergadering.
Ik zou graag de mogelijkheid van een kleine investering willen bespreken. We zijn van plan om een oude glasblazerij en de lange traditie van glasproductie in onze regio te herstellen. We kochten een oud glasfabrieksgebouw en ik heb ook verschillende bekwame mensen aangetrokken, glasblazers met vele jaren ervaring, meesters in het vak.

Helaas hebben we nog niet genoeg geld om de productie te starten. Volgens berekeningen zou %0 genoeg zijn voor ons om het glasfabrieksgebouw te repareren en de glasblazers de eerste paar maanden te betalen.

Wilt u ons hiermee helpen?

Goed om u weer te zien. Een jaar was best lang, maar ik heb goed nieuws. De productie is gestart en we ondertekenden een contract met de eerste klant, tot nu toe slechts een kleintje. We zijn nog steeds op zoek naar een aantal grotere klanten en winkelketens.

Helaas heeft het hele project veel geld nodig, iets meer dan we hadden verwacht. Ik kom meteen ter zake: wilt u meer geld in ons investeren? Ik bied u een groter aandeel in het bedrijf. De initiële investering heeft ons in het begin heel goed geholpen, maar helaas zijn de kosten van marketing en de acquisitie van grote orders aanzienlijk groter.

Super goed!
Met zo'n grote partner aan boord, zullen we zeker meer klanten krijgen en de productie verhogen (en dus de waarde van uw aandeel in de glasfabriek). Voor zo'n bedrijf als het uwe is het niet zo veel geld, maar geloof me, u hebt een paar mensen geholpen om hun dromen waar te maken. Glasfabricage bestond in het gebied vanaf het begin van de 14e eeuw, en dankzij u zal het niet snel weer verdwijnen.

Momenteel bespreken we met een zakenpartner het op maat maken van glaswerk voor hun restauratierijtuigen. Ik moet hem aan u voorstellen, hij is net zo'n liefhebber van treinen als u.

Ik ben op zoek naar een zandleverancier voor onze glasfabriek en het zand in de omliggende mijnen lijkt van hoge kwaliteit te zijn, zodat het in de glasindustrie kan worden gebruikt. Dat is ook de reden waarom glasproductie altijd zo'n goede traditie heeft gehad in onze regio.

In onze glasfabrieken raakt het zand echter langzaam op en zal het ook nodig zijn om onszelf goed te bevoorraden om de productie uit te breiden. Daarom zou ik u willen vragen om meer zand te leveren uit de omliggende mijnen. Ik heb de opslagruimte al geregeld, zodat we meteen kunnen beginnen.

Gegroet mijn vriend.

De productie van glas gaat in volle vaart en we hebben genoeg zand, misschien zelfs voor een jaar. Het zou moeilijk zijn geweest om dit zonder u te bereiken, tot nu toe kan ik het nog steeds niet geloven en u krijgt onze eeuwige dank.

Verschillende bedrijven hebben aangegeven geïnteresseerd te zijn in het kopen van onze glasfabriek. Onze basis eis is dat we onafhankelijk willen blijven, zelfs na de overname. Alleen de manager van Glossy Glasses gaf ons dergelijke garanties. Ze hebben serieuze interesse in de glasfabriek en zij zijn de enigen die onze voorwaarden hebben aanvaard.

Σου έχω ακόμα μία προσφορά που ίσως σε ενδιαφέρει. Τα ξυλουργεία μας παράγουν περισσότερη ξυλεία από όση μπορούμε να μεταφέρουμε με τα μέσα που ήδη έχουμε και οι αποθήκες μας σχεδόν γέμισαν! Θέλουμε να ενώσεις με ράγες, τα ξυλουργεία μας απ'ευθείας με τα τοπικά εργαστήρια για να επιταχυνθεί η μεταφορά πρώτης ύλης.

Πραγματικά χρειάζεται να επενδύσουμε στις εγκαταστάσεις των σταθμών μας. Έχουμε ένα μόνο γερανό με αποτέλεσμα οι φορτοεκφορτώσεις να είναι υπερβολικά αργές. Οι επιβάτες δεν βρίσκουν που να καθίσουν στο χώρο αναμονής και έτισ χρησιμοποιούν μία εξωτερική τουαλέτα! Κάτι πρέπει να κάνουμε.

Ήρθα σε συμφωνία με αρκετά ξυλουργεία ώστε να αγοράσουν αυτούς του κορμούς. Έχω το ανθρώπινο δυναμικό αλλά δεν ξέρω πως να μεταφέρω τόσους κορμούς. Αν με βοηθήσεις θα μοιραστούμε τα έσοδα.

Τα αποθέματα ορυκτού σιδήρου που ανακαλύφθηκαν πρόσφατα είναι εντυπωσιακά. Τα χυτήρια έχουν την υποστήριξη της κυβέρνησης ώστε να επεξεργάζονται ακόμα περισσότερο ορυκτό αλλά κάποιος πρέπει να το μεταφέρει εκεί πρώτα...

Αυτή είναι μια τέλεια στιγμή για να εισέλθουμε ως εταιρία σε αυτό τον τομέα. Έκανα όλες τις απαραίτητες διαπραγματεύσεις ώστε να λάβουμε οικονομική ενίσχυση και άδειες από την τοπική αυτοδιοίκηση, αλλά ως όρο συμβολαίου θέλουν να μεταφέρουμε και κάρβουνο.

Χαίρετε,

Η μικρή μας ενορία στερείται τόπου προσευχής και καταφυγίου. Από την κοινότητά μας, αποκτήσαμε μια εγκαταλελειμμένη εκκλησία την οποία σκοπεύουμε να ανακαινίσουμε. Οι πιστοί μας θα μας βοηθήσουν αλλά χρειαζόμαστε πρώτες ύλες και γι'αυτό χρειαζόμαστε τη βοήθειά σου. Πήραμε προμήθειες από το εκκλησίασμά μας. Δεν είναι πολλές αλλά νομίζουμε ότι αρκούν.

Η φήμη μας έχει επεκταθεί τόσο που πλέον έχουμε πολλαπλές προτάσεις για συνεργασία. Δυστυχώς όμως δεν προλαβαίνουμε να ασχοληθούμε με όλους. Οι δύο πιο ενδιαφέρουσες προτάσεις είναι:

Κυβερνητικό συμβόλαιο για μεταφορά επιβατών
Μεταφορά ράβδων σιδήρου για μεγαλοβιομήχανο.

Καλή επιλογή. Είναι μια απλή συμφωνία με την κυβέρνηση που θα επεκτείνει τις υποδομές μας χωρίς να είναι κάτι πολύπλοκο.

Αν εξαιρέσουμε βέβαια ότι είναι το μεγαλύτερο συμβόλαιο που αναλάβαμε ποτέ! Ίσως αυτό είναι μια μεγάλη πρόκληση και δοκιμασία για τις δυνατότητές σου.

Γιατί ακόμα αγοράζουμε αυτά τα σάπια τρένα? Πλέον υπάρχουν ταχύτερες και νεότερες αμαξοστοιχίες. Χρειάζεται μια επένδυση αλλά είμαι σίγουρος ότι ο κ. Τσώλης θα καταφέρει να βρει κάποια συνεισφορά. Μια κυβερνητική χορηγία ή ίσως κάτι άλλο?

   Παρακαλώ να έχετε στο νου σας πως αυτή είναι μια αρχική μορφή του παιχνιδιού η οποία βρίσκεται ακόμα υπό σημαντική εξέλιξη.
Έχω εργαστεί πάνω σε αυτό το παιχνίδι μόνος μου για 7 έτη και τώρα μέσω της κοινότητας και ταλαντούχων ανθρώπων που με πλαισιώνουν, στοχεύουμε να εξελίξουμε το καλύτερο παιχνίδι διαχείρισης που έχει δημιουργηθεί.
                                                                                                       Jan Zeleny
     \c\c\i22AA397D \cF0EAC2\bΑπομένουν να ολοκληρωθούν:\b

     - Παιχνίδι πολλών παικτών (Multiplayer)
     - Επιλογή για οδήγηση τρένου (ήδη μπορείς να επιβιβαστείς σε ένα τρένο το οποίο όμως ελέγχεται από τον υπολογιστή)
     - Μερικές εκκρεμότητες όπως τελειοποίηση των εικονιδίων και επεξηγήσεις
     - Πιθανότατα να συναντήσετε σημειώσεις που αφορούν κείμενο αλλά και γραφικά.

Most ennyi volt eddig!

Elérted a Mashinky korai hozzáférésnek végét! Játszhatsz tovább, de nincs több küldetés, sem korszak befejezve.

\i8EB66346 \c484539Amit a végleges játék tartalmazni fog:\c
\iDEAFDEAF

 - 7 korszak a Gőzkorszaktól a Jövőig
 - 16 különböző árucikk és 21 ipar
 - Több mint 25 féle mozdony és 40 különböző vasúti kocsi 
 - Több történet, küldetés, kihívás és játékbéli esemény
 - Játékos irányította vonatok
 - Többjátékos mód egészen 8 játékosig
 - Mód támogatás a Steam Workshop-ban (ott egyedi vonatok, új iparok, stb.)
 - És még sok más ... Beleértve a más közlekedési típusokra vonatkozó terveket is!

\iDEAFDEAF
Kérlek vedd figyelembe, hogy ez alfa verzió, átfogó fejlesztés alatt áll. 
7 éve egyedül dolgoztam ezen a játékon, de most együtt a közösséggel 
és körül véve hozzáértő emberekkel, elkészítjük a valaha volt legjobb építős játékot.

Köszönjük a támogatást!

Ez egy soha vissza nem térő alkalom a vállalatod számára! Itt gyakorlatilag nincs közlekedési infrastruktúra. Ezt ki kell használnod.

Úgy gondolom, a legjobb dolog az lenne, hogy az utasok szállításával kezdj. Ez egy olcsó módja annak, hogy pénzt keress, és elinduljon a vállalatod.

Csak így tovább! Az állam érdeke is az infrastruktúra bővítés, így pénzügyi támogatásban részesített. Befektethetsz a közlekedési hálózat bővítésébe, vagy más bevételi forrást is kereshetsz. Ilyen például a farönkök és a szén importálása.

Hadd mutassam be magam. Molnár Gyula vagyok, az LMBR Deputy Co-tól. Cégünk a helyi ipar fejlesztésébe kíván befektetni. Ezért vettem fel Önnel a kapcsolatot.

Először is szeretnénk, ha farönköket tudna szállítani a fűrésztelepeinknek. Az erdők itt vannak a közelben, ezért nem lesz nehéz fát kitermelni. Ha sikerül ellátnia az üzemeinket, akkor tisztességesen megfizetjük munkásságát, és később lehet hogy több munkánk is lenne a vállalata számára!

Szép munka! A szállítások tökéletesek! A fűrésztelepeink már fűrészárut termelnek, és a töltik raktárainkat.

Eddig úgy néz ki, hogy minden jól alakul! A feletteseink boldogok, és ez egy elég ritka dolog. Remélem, hogy ez így marad sokáig.

Ha érdekli, van egy másik ajánlatom is. A fűrésztelepeink több fűrészárut termelnek, mint ahogy a lovaskocsik elbírnák szállítani őket, és a raktáraink majdnem megteltek! Szeretnénk, ha a faáru elszállítását a vasúton is megoldhatnánk, a túltermelés elkerülése végett.

Nemrég felfedezett vasércbányák nagyon izgalmasak. Az öntödéknek kormányzati támogatást nyújtanak vasérc feldolgozásához, viszont nem szállítja el magát el csak úgy...

Ez a tökéletes pillanat ahhoz, hogy vállalatunk bejusson ezen a piacon. Sikeresen tárgyaltam pénzügyi támogatásról a helyi hatóságokkal, de a szerződés részeként azt is szeretnék, ha szenet is szállítanánk.

Tudod, a vasúti birodalmad jól halad és időnként nem árt megtartani azt a jól kiérdemelt pihenőt.

Jó napot!
Valószínűleg tudja, hogy ebben az évtizedben bemutattuk a piacon a legmodernebb dízelmozdonyokat. Jelenleg az 52 típusú mozdony fejlesztett változatát fejezzük be, amelynek tesztelésébe kezdtünk. Miközben ugyanazokat a működési költségeket tartottuk, sikerült elérnünk a nagyobb teljesítményt és a magasabb maximális sebességet. Ezekkel a paraméterekkel ideális utasok hosszú távú szállítására.

Mivel a mozdonyaink már használatban vannak, szeretnénk felajánlani a Bdz 52+ prototípusunkat tesztelésre. Mint mondtam, a legjobb az utasok szállítására. Ha mindennek sikerül, ingyen adunk újabb Bdz 52+ teszt mozdonyokat.

Szóval benne vagy?

Elkezdheti a tesztelést, nagyon kíváncsiak vagyunk a véleményeire. Elképzelhető, hogy képes lesz elérni a legnagyobb sebességét a egyenes vonalakon, a városok között.

Hé, van egy csodálatos hírem. Az iparügyi miniszter közeli köréből megtudtam, hogy van egy kis fekete arany lelőhely - olaj!

Nem sokkal később, a támogatási gép elindul, és a minisztérium már vonzza a befektetőket a bányászat megkezdéséhez. Természetesen több lelőhely lesz, és ha nem állunk félre, akkor erős nyereséget tudunk elérni.

A petrolkémiai ipar fejlődése a mi területünkön is jelen van, mint üzemanyagforrás, több okunk van arra hogy dízelüzemű mozdonyokba fektessünk be. Szükség lesz a kezdeti befektetésre, de mi nem veszíthetünk ezen.

Néhány évvel ezelőtt az olajimport szerződéssel foglalkoztam, és ezt szeretném folytatni. Meg kell találnunk a finomítóink kőolajtermékek / vegyi anyagok szállításának megoldását. A szállítási társaságok többségének nincs rá kapacitása.

A raktáraink néha olyan tele vannak, hogy meg kell állítanunk a termelést, és ez annyi pénzbe kerül, amelyet el sem tudsz képzelni. Nem fogok felesleges költségeket fizetni a finomítónak, amit nem termel, jobb lenne leállítaniuk.

Több éven keresztül tudósaink mindent megtetettek azért, hogy csökkentsék a járművek üzemeltetéséből származó szennyeződéseket a városokban, és növeljék a közlekedés gazdaságosságát a mai vasutakon. A galváncellákkal és a független vontatással kapcsolatos számos sikertelen teszt után elkészül a felső áramszedő első prototípusa, és hamarosan az első elektromosan hajtott mozdony működőképes lesz.

Rengeteg előnnyel jár. Legyen ökológiai vagy főként gazdaságos. De mi be akarjuk fejezni a prototípust, és meg kell építeni az első villamosított pályát. A beruházás nem lesz kicsi, de hatalmas technikai vezetők leszünk.

Régóta kerülgetjük azt a mozdonyt ami a felső depó mögött áll, és pár tél óta már kezd rozsdásodni. Dokumentumaink szerint nem hozzánk tartozik, de senki sem keresi ezt.
Szégyen ilyen módon elhagyni, nem igaz?

Büyük bir sorunum var. Aslında, ikimizin de sorunu var. Şirketimiz odun işleme teknolojisine çok yatırım yaptı. Şirketiniz ise, hızarhanelerimizin yarım kapasitesine yetecek kadar bile taşıma yapamıyor.

Odun teslimatını, en azından hızarhanelerimizin yarım kapasitesini karşılayacak kadar artırmanızı istiyoruz.

Arkadaşım, son birkaç aydır çok çalıştığını ve bir süreliğine ara vermen gerektiğini düşünüyorum.

Demiryolu imparatorluğun altın çağını yaşıyor. Zaman zaman ara vermeyi hak ediyorsun. Yeni trenlerinden birine atla, lokanta vagonunda sunulan yemeklerin tadını çıkar ya da istersen makinistlerin yanında dur ve etrafı izle. İşlere ara ver ve kırsalın keyfini sür.

İyi günler,
Bileceğiniz üzere, kısa süre önce modern dizel lokomotifleri pazara çıkarmıştık. Şu anda 52. prototipin gelişmiş versiyonunun deneme sürüşlerini gerçekleştiriyoruz. Lokomotifimiz aynı maliyete karşın daha yüksek performansa ve hıza sahip. Elimizdeki verilere göre, uzun mesafede yolcu taşımada bu lokomotiften iyisi yok.

Lokomotiflerimiz kullanılmaya başlandı. Denemeniz için size de 52Ü prototipinden vermek istiyoruz. Daha önce de belirttiğim gibi, yolcu taşıma konusunda piyasada daha iyisi yok. Her şey yolunda giderse, yine denemeniz için 52Ü prototipinden bir tane daha vereceğiz. Üstelik ücret talep etmeyeceğiz.

Var mısınız?

Güzel haberlerim var. Sanayi Bakanlığı'na yakın çevrelerden elde ettiğimiz bilgilere göre kısa süre önce küçük bir kara altın, yani petrol kaynağı bulunmuş!

Sonrasında devletin desteğiyle makineler bölgede çalışmaya başlamış. Geçenlerde, Bakanlık yatırım çekmek için gereken her şeyin yapılacağını duyurmuştu. Daha çok kaynak bulunacağı aşikar. Eğer dahil olursak, bu işten iyi gelir elde edebiliriz.

Petrokimya endüstrisinin gelişerek sektörümüzde yeni bir yakıt kaynağını kullanıma açmasıyla, lokomotiflerde kullanılabilecek dizel motorlara yatırım yapmamız gerektiğini görmüş olduk. Bu şekilde düşünen bir tek biz değiliz. Bu konuda gereken her ne olursa olsun yapmalıyız.

Bir süre önce birtakım petrol çıkarma anlaşması yaptık. Anlaşmayı sürdürmek niyetindeyim. Rafinerilerimizden gelen petrol ürünleri ve kimyasalların taşınması konusundaki sıkıntıyı gidermeliyim. Mevcuttaki çoğu taşımacılık şirketi bize göre yetersiz kalıyor.

Kimi zaman antrepolarımız dolduğundan üretimi durdurmak zorunda kalıyoruz. Hayal edemeyeceğiniz miktarlarda zarar ediyoruz. Artık rafinerilerin gereksiz masraflarını karşılamayacağım. Üretim yapmayacaksak kapatmamız daha iyi olacaktır.

Porter modeli treni bilmem kaç yıl önceki bir sergiden beri eski bir depoda tutuyorlar. Bence bu lokomotifle ne yapacaklarını bilmiyorlar. Güzel bir emektar aslında, ama böyle bir hurda bizim ne işimize yarar ki?

Merhaba,

Bölgedeki çelikhanenin sahibiyim. Birkaç yıldır güneybatıdaki maden işletmesiyle çalışıyoruz. Bir süredir teslim aldığımız kumları stokluyorduk. Gelişmeler sonucunda silikon çelik üretimimiz arttığından daha az kuvars (kum) kullanarak daha fazla çelik üretebiliyoruz. Ürettiğimiz çeliğe olan talep artıyor. Fabrikalara çelik yetiştirecek ulaşım ağına sahip deliğiz. Dolayısıyla, size bir teklifte bulunacağım.

Becerikli bir iş adamı olduğunuzu söylüyorlar. Ayrıca, elinizde %0 yokmuş. Anlaşabilirsek size belli bir miktarda %0 verebilirim. İsterseniz kum taşımak için kullandığımız fazla vagonları da verebilirim. Karşılığında elimdeki hammaddeleri çelikhanelere, ürettiğimiz çelikleri de bölgedeki fabrikalara taşımanızı istiyorum. Ne diyorsunuz?

Bölgeye taşınan genç nüfus ve şirket sayısı giderek artıyor. Bakanlık, hizmet verimliliğini artırmak ve önemli birkaç şehir arasındaki ulaşımı hızlandırmak için bir omurga hattı inşa etmeye karar verdi. Genç kesimin ne kadar rahatına düşkün olduğunu bilirsiniz. 

Bakanlık bölgedeki gelişimin daha da çarpıcı bir hal almasını umuyor. Elbette şirketiniz de bundan faydalanacaktır.

Merhaba dostum, nasılsın?
Aldığın yeni trenleri gördüm. Hurdaya dönen buharlılara bin basacak kadar varlarmış. Bu işe giriştiğin ilk treni hatırlıyorum. Kıytırık bir şeydi. Üstelik yakıt için kenara para atman gerekirdi.

Bir yerde bu yeni trenlerin %1 %2 ile, hatta belki çok daha hızlı gidebileceklerini duymuştum. Makinistlerden birine sorduğumda bunun mümkün olduğunu, fakat sağlam, uzuncasına düz bir hat gerektiğini söyledi. Bizim dolambaçlı kıytırık raylarda deneyemezsin bile...

Mevcut santral bloklarının genişletilmesi planlanıyormuş. Yeni blokların bir kısmının denetimi başlamış. Elektriğin bu yıl ağa aktarılması bekleniyormuş.

Santrallerin, kömür olsun, petrol olsun, çok yağ tükettiği aşikar. Büyük bir demiryolu ağımız var. Üstüne bir de onca yıllık kömür ve petrol taşıma deneyimimiz var.

Bu madencilik şirketi ile gerçekleştirdiğimiz işbirliği, hem gelecekte ulaşım alanında daha fazla teşvik verilmesini, hem de bölgede yeni madenlerin kurulmasını sağlayabilir.

Bununla birlikte, teslimattan önce böylesine uzun bir treni ray üstünde denemeliyiz.

Deneme sürüşü için vagonları ve tercihen başka bir lokomotifi daha bağladığınızdan emin olun. Özellikle tren yüklü olacaksa. İstenen parametreleri elde etmek için genellikle üç lokomotif kullanılıyormuş.

Sizinle tanıştığıma memnun oldum. Görüşme teklifimi kabul ettiğiniz için teşekkür ederim.
Ufak bir yatırım fırsatı hakkında size bilgi vermek istiyorum. Eski bir cam fabrikasını tadilata almak ve bölgedeki cam üretim geleneğini sürdürmek niyetindeyim. Emrim altında oldukça deneyimli birkaç camcı bulunuyor. Kendileri bu işte oldukça iyiler.

Ne yazık ki üretime başlamak için yeterli sermayemiz bulunmuyor. Hesaplamalara göre fabrikayı tadilata alıp camcıların ilk birkaç aylık maaşlarını ödemek için %0 yeterli olacak

Sizi yeniden gördüğüme sevindim. Bir yıl oldukça uzun bir zamandı. Size iyi haberlerim var. Üretime başladık ve ilk müşterimizle sözleşme imzaladık. Şu anda başka müşterimiz yok. Daha büyük müşteriler ve perakende zincirleri aramaya devam ediyoruz.

Korkarım projemizin beklediğimizden daha fazla sermayeye ihtiyacı varmış. Doğrudan konuya gireceğim: Bize biraz daha yatırım yapmak ister misiniz? Karşılığında size şirketten büyük miktarda hisse vereceğim.

Çok iyi!
Böylesine güçlü bir ortakla daha fazla müşteri bulup üretimi artıracağımıza (hisselerinizin değeri de katlanacak) eminim. Sizin büyüklüğünüzdeki bir şirket için bu para hiçbir şeydir, fakat o para sayesinde birçok insanın hayalleri gerçek olacak. Camcılık 14. yüzyıldan beri varlığını sürdüren bir zanaattir. Sayenizde bölgemizde de varlığını sürdürecek.

Şu anda iş ortaklarımdan biriyle lokanta vagonlarında servis edilen bardakları görüşüyoruz. Sizin onunla tanıştırmalıyım. O da sizin gibi trenlere epey ilgi duyan bir kimse.

Anlıyorum. Öyle bile olsa ilk yatırım için çok çok teşekkür ederiz. Bir de kredi çekmeye çalışacağız. En şık takımımı giyip birkaç bankayla görüşmem gerekecek.

Bu sırada üretimimiz devam edecek. Yani yatırımınız konusunda endişelenmenize gerek yok. Örneğin, daha dün birkaç küçük dükkanla anlaştım. Önümüzdeki ay başımızı kurtarmaya yeteceklerdir.

Yatırımınızı geri istiyorsanız, ödemek için elimizde yeterli para bulunuyor. Elbette ortaklığımızı sürdürmeniz bizi mutlu eder.

Fabrikaya kum tedarik edecek bir yer arıyordum. Çevre madenlerdeki kum kaliteli olduğundan cam endüstrisinde kullanılabiliyor. Zaten bu yüzden bu bölgede camcılık geleneği çok ilerlemiş.

Ancak fabrikadaki kum tedariğimiz yavaşça azalıyor. Üstelik üretimi artırmak için iyi tedarik sağlamalıyız. Bu yüzden sizden çevredeki madenlerden fabrikamıza kum taşımanızı istiyorum. Depo bölmesini çoktan ayarladığımızdan derhal başlayabilirsiniz. Bu arada ürünlerimizi kasabalara da taşıyabilirsiniz.

Merhaba dostum.

Cam üretimi tam hız devam ediyor. Elimizde belki bir yıl yetecek kadar kum var. Siz olmadan buralara gelemezdik. Hala yaptıklarınıza inanamıyor ve sonsuz teşekkürlerimi sunuyorum.

Birkaç şirket cam fabrikamızı satın almak istediğini belirtti. Temel isteğimiz, satın alındıktan sonra dahil bağımsız kalmak. Bir tek Cilalı Cam A.Ş. bize bunun garantisini verebildi. Cam endüstrisinde büyük bir etkiye sahipler. Anlaşma şartlarımızı bir tek onlar kabul etti.

Đầu tiên, chúng tôi cần gỗ được vận chuyển đến các xưởng cưa của chúng tôi. Xung quanh đây không hề thiếu gỗ nên chắc không khó khăn gì với ông. Lần này thành công, ông sẽ được trả hậu hĩnh và chúng ta còn hợp tác lâu dài!

Tuyệt vời! Ban giám đốc rất vui mừng, và đây là dịp hiếm hoi. Hi vọng chúng ta còn làm ăn lâu dài.

Nếu ông có nhã ý, tôi có một đề nghị như sau. Xưởng cưa của chúng tôi sản xuất ngày đêm,.bây giờ đội xe ngựa không thể vận chuyển hết và kho lẫm thì đầy ắp rồi. Tôi đề nghị xây những tuyến nối giữa xưởng cưa và xưởng mộc để tiêu thụ nhanh.

cùng với cộng đồng và những người tài giỏi hỗ trợ tôi,
chúng tôi sẽ ra sức làm cho game hoàn hảo nhất có thể.

Jan Zeleny
     \c\c\i22AA397D \cF0EAC2\bHiện trạng và dự định:\b
    - Multiplayer
    - Tự lái tàu (bạn vẫn có thể sử dụng góc nhìn trên tàu)
    - Vẫn còn một số biểu tượng và tooltip chưa ổn định.
    - Một số dòng chữ có thể không hiển thị đúng.

     \c\c\i8EB66346 \cF0EAC2\bPhiên bản chính thức sẽ có:\b
     - 7 thời đại từ tàu hơi nước đến thời hiện đại
     - 16 loại hàng hóa và 21 nhà máy
     - Hơn 25 đầu máy và 40 loại toa xe
     - Thêm nhiệm vụ, thử thách, sự kiện ngẫu nhiên
     - Multiplayer tối đa 8 người
     - Hỗ trợ Mod thông qua Steam Workshop
     - Và còn hơn thế nữa... dự định sẽ bổ sung các phương tiện giao thông khác.

Esta é uma oportunidade única para a nossa empresa! Não existe qualquer infrastrutura de transportte aqui. Deviamos tirar vantagem disto.

Eu acho que a melhor coisa seria começar a mover passageiros. É uma maneira barata de fazer algum dinheiro e por a tua empresa a andar.

Continua assim! O estado está interessado em expandir a infrastrutura também, por isso recebemos uma pequena quantia de dinheiro. Podes investi-lo na expansão da rede de transporte e procurar por outras fontes de lucro, tal como a importação de troncos e carvão.
