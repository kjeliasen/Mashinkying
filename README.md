## Modding and such with Mashinky

Taking the original xml files from the game = specifically targeting the English translations.
Mods in the "Mods_Orig" folder are local copies of mods obtained from the Steam workshop. I will be tweaking these same mods in the Mods_Edits folder.

This is learning by doing. I am adjusting things created by others to suit my own gameplay preferences.
