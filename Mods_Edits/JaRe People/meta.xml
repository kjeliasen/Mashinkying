- wroker (orange passenger)
- returner & tourist (old white passaagier)
Every industry needs workers (orange) who want to go home after work or go on vacation (white).

Modified default settings of cargo.
Disadvantage: Since only one cargo per carriage is possible, the passenger cars are duplicated.
Compatible with my own mods.

===========================================================================
=== Update 'fish and apples' for Mashinky Update '5th era' ist out now

The workers are now recovering much slower.
To recover quickly, the workers now need fresh food (from new Mashinky update) and 'fish and apples' (inside of this update).

This indirectly involves farmers in the success of the industry chain.

Disadvantage: I can not define a rule that fishermen are only placed near water. I count on your kindness.

In the ingame store you will find new buildings from me. Also the 1x fisherman.

===========================================================================
=== Ingame Store

Fishermen can be buyed in the online store. Two can only be bought once, the third as often as you can pay.

===========================================================================
=== 2019 Patch

Changes: Returner are no more purple (first version of this mod), but simple white passanger.
