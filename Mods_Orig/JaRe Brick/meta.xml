<description value="For me, the small price difference was never a reason to build wooden bridges. I immediately used stone bridges.

To motivate you and me, I've added a new cargo and new token stone. Tunnels and stone bridges now cost stone tokens. Stones can be made in the quarry and converted into tokens in the crusher. Therefore, new cars like coal cars are needed for transportation.

In addition, I've duplicated the known landscapes. Here the terrain change also costs stone tokens. Marks are those in the name with '$ Bricks'.

Modified default settings of TOOLWORKS and FACTORY.

Compatible with my own mods.
